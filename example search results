He is one of the researchers Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory that discovered the cause for the growth of needle-like structures—known as dendrites and whiskers—that are harmful to lithium-ion batteries. (Image source: Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) \n\n\n\nOne major drawback to lithium-ion batteries is that they have potential to short circuit, which can not only degrade them, but also cause them to catch fire.\n\nResearchers already know the reason for this scenario – the growth of needle-like structures known as dendrites and whiskers within the battery. However, they never knew the exact source of the formation of these structures—until now.\n\nA team of scientists at the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has discovered that the presence of certain compounds in a battery’s electrolyte causes the growth of dendrites and whiskers.\n\nThe team published a paper on their work in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.\n\nResearchers hope that this discovery will lead to the development of ways to prevent dendrite growth by creating new material formulas and chemistries for lithium-ion batteries, said Chongmin Wang, PNNL lead researcher on the project.\n\n“We don’t want to simply suppress the growth of dendrites; we want to get to the root cause and eliminate them,” Wang said in a press statement.\n\nDendrites are dangerous because they can pierce a structure known as the separator inside a battery and also increase unwanted reactions between the electrolyte and the lithium. These factors can speed up battery failure and cause short circuiting and, potentially, flammability.\n\nWhat researchers at PNNL discovered is that dendrites and whiskers originate in a structure known as the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI)—basically, where the solid lithium surface meets the liquid electrolyte, which is typically a film.\n\nThey also identified the culprit in the growth of these structures – ethylene carbonate, an indispensable solvent added to electrolytes to enhance battery performance. While it may be necessary to the function of the battery, it also leaves the battery vulnerable to damage, according to the researchers.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES:\tCoating Advances Lithium-Metal Battery Research\n\tPioneers of the Lithium-Ion Battery Awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\tFlexible Lithium Ion Battery Breakthrough\n\n\n\nTo achieve their result, the PNNL researchers had to capture the step-by-step process of what happens when a dendrite forms, which begins when lithium ions start to clump, or “nucleate,” on the surface of the anode. Like a stalagmite in a cave, the structure grows slowly as more and more lithium atoms attach to it.\n\nTo capture this growth process, scientists integrated an atomic force microscope (AFM) and an environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM). The latter is a high-performance instrument that allows scientists to study an operating battery under real conditions.\n\nThe researchers used the AFM to measure the tiny force of the whisker as it grew, pushing down on its tip with the cantilever of the AFM and measuring the force the dendrite exerted, they said.\n\nWhat they eventually discovered is that the more ethylene carbonate that they put in the electrolyte, the more the whiskers grew. The scientists experimented with the electrolyte mix, changing ingredients to try to reduce dendrite growth, with some positive results. The addition of cyclohexanone, for example, prevented the growth of dendrites and whiskers, researchers found.\n\nThe researchers hope that this new understanding of dendrite formation and growth will lead to new ideas for eliminating them, or at least controlling them to minimize damage. This could help pave the way for new and improved lithium-ion performance in next-generation devices and automobiles.\n\n“My hope is that our findings will spur the community to look at this problem in new ways,” Wang said in a press statement. “Clearly, more research is needed.”\n\nElizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer who has written about technology and culture for more than 20 years.

A month later, an electric scooter sparked a fire inside a New York City apartment that killed a 5-year-old girl and 36-year-old woman. And last month, a fire believed to be caused by the batteries in an electric scooter engulfed a multifamily home in Brockton, Massachusetts.\nLithium-ion batteries have become a ubiquitous feature in new forms of transportation and common household products. They're also found in residential solar energy systems. \n\n\n\nBut when those batteries fail or overheat, they release flammable, toxic gasses that can spark a fast-spreading fire that is extremely difficult to extinguish. \n“The source of the gasses that are creating the flames is confined within a cell battery that will not allow water in,” said Ofodike Ezekoye, a fire scientist and professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. “When firefighters are responding to these types of incidents, it takes a lot longer to be able to control the fire because it requires so much more water.”\nWith the number of fires caused by lithium batteries soaring across the U.S., firefighters and other experts say the training needed to fight them effectively is lagging in many places. Firefighters and city officials are also imploring the manufacturers to redesign the batteries so that, when they fail, the resulting fires can be put down more easily.\n“What we’re seeing is these new technologies, as important as they are, they make it out into the field before we know all the possible consequences that could come from them,” said Steve Kerber, the executive director of the nonprofit UL Fire Safety Research Institute. “It isn’t until failures start to happen that the fire service understands what the consequences are. That’s where we need to start playing catch-up.”\nA test lithium battery fire by the Fire Safety Research Institute, in which a battery with disabled safety features created a violent explosion.Fire Safety Research InstituteKerber said his team has run tests on lithium-ion batteries in which it took only 15 seconds from the first sign of smoke to the windows being blown out in a house. In a traditional fire, it typically takes about three minutes for a room to be engulfed, he said.\n\n\n“With such explosion hazards, it’s incredibly important that we get firefighters to understand how to operate safely,” Kerber said.\nHunter Clare and Justin Lopez, who work for the fire department in Peoria, Arizona, have firsthand experience of the hazards.\nIn April 2019, the two fire captains responded to a call at a facility that was housing thousands of lithium-ion batteries used to store energy for a power grid. The batteries are critical components in such facilities that store solar energy.\nClare and Lopez arrived along with other first responders to find a white cloud of vapor seeping out of the building and drifting across the desert.\n\n\n“It was staying about 3 to 4 feet off the ground, and it was kind of swaying like sea water,” Clare said.\nJustin Lopez and Hunter Clare, who work for the fire department in Peoria, Ariz. NBC NewsThe firefighters suspected that it was some kind of chemical cocktail. They secured the area and used special devices to test the air, which showed dangerous levels of hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide. \nThen they waited until the vapors stopped flowing out of the building and the levels of flammable gas dropped. Nearly two hours passed before the firefighters made their way to the front door of the facility. When they opened it, a large cloud escaped the building. Before they could retreat to safety, the space ignited, setting off a powerful explosion.\n\n\nLopez landed 30 feet away, according to a report by the Fire Safety Research Institute. Clare was thrown about 70 feet, his body in flames.\n“Don’t remember the explosion. Don’t remember anything from there,” Clare said.\nBoth men suffered severe injuries, including brain trauma. \nLopez had a collapsed lung, broken ribs, a broken leg, separated shoulder, laceration of the liver and multiple thermal and chemical burns, according to the report.  \n\n\n\nClare suffered an eye injury, spine damage, broken ribs, broken ankles, a broken scapula, internal bleeding and thermal and chemical burns.\n\nBut they know they’re lucky to be alive. \n“It could have been worse,” Lopez said.\n“If you got there, and you were in the middle of nowhere and didn’t have the training that you needed, you might rush in,” Clare said.\n\n\nThe rise of electric scooters in cities has led to a massive spike in battery fires.\nLithium-ion batteries sparked more than 200 fires in New York City last year alone, killing six people and injuring nearly 150. That’s double the amount of battery fires in 2021, according to the New York City Fire Department. \nSo far this year, electric bike batteries have been identified as the cause of three fires in New York. \nThe most recent blaze broke out inside a building in the Inwood section of Manhattan on Feb. 5. Three people were hospitalized in critical condition, officials said. Last week, an e-bike battery sparked a fire at a day care center in Queens that injured nearly 20 children.\n\n\nKeith Badler, senior technical trainer with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said he’s particularly concerned about the threat of a battery fire in a bridge or a tunnel. He noted that it often takes a massive amount of water to extinguish the chemical-fueled blazes.\n“We don’t have the luxury of just letting it burn out in the open, or in a tunnel or even in a bridge,” Badler said. \nA test lithium battery fire by the Fire Safety Research Institute, in which a battery with disabled safety features created a violent explosion.Fire Safety Research InstituteAn industry trade group, PRBA — the Portable Rechargeable Battery Association — said it is “collaborating with emergency response governmental agencies and industry organizations to increase awareness about the risks posed by lithium ion batteries during handling, storage, and in transportation.”\n“We welcome the opportunity to work with all interested parties on lithium ion battery outreach and education to prevent lithium ion battery incidents, increase consumer safety, and develop a consistent message on the correct lithium ion battery emergency response and safety procedures,” the group added.\n\n\nSome fire departments in Arizona and elsewhere have added a new tool to fight these kinds of fires: a chemical additive specially designed to absorb heat and put down certain kinds of blazes.\nThe product, known as F-500 Encapsulator Agent, has shown in early tests to be effective at putting out the stubborn fires created by lithium-ion batteries. \n“We’re absorbing the heat as opposed to trying to dissipate the heat through steam,” said Ron Lowrey, a former fire chief in Pennsylvania who now works for one company that produces the product, Hazard Control Technologies. “It’s a much better medium for cooling.”\n\n\nVicky NguyenVicky Nguyen is the senior consumer investigative correspondent for NBC News.

Now, the Department of Energy has discovered where they come from. \n\n\n\nElizabeth Montalbano | Nov 05, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Event\n\nATX Canada 2023\nMay 09, 2023 to May 11, 2023\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tResearcher Yang He adds a sample to the environmental transmission electron microscope. He is one of the researchers Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory that discovered the cause for the growth of needle-like structures—known as dendrites and whiskers—that are harmful to lithium-ion batteries. (Image source: Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) \n\n\n\nOne major drawback to lithium-ion batteries is that they have potential to short circuit, which can not only degrade them, but also cause them to catch fire.\n\nResearchers already know the reason for this scenario – the growth of needle-like structures known as dendrites and whiskers within the battery. However, they never knew the exact source of the formation of these structures—until now.\n\nA team of scientists at the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has discovered that the presence of certain compounds in a battery’s electrolyte causes the growth of dendrites and whiskers.\n\nThe team published a paper on their work in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.\n\nResearchers hope that this discovery will lead to the development of ways to prevent dendrite growth by creating new material formulas and chemistries for lithium-ion batteries, said Chongmin Wang, PNNL lead researcher on the project.\n\n“We don’t want to simply suppress the growth of dendrites; we want to get to the root cause and eliminate them,” Wang said in a press statement.\n\nDendrites are dangerous because they can pierce a structure known as the separator inside a battery and also increase unwanted reactions between the electrolyte and the lithium. These factors can speed up battery failure and cause short circuiting and, potentially, flammability.\n\nWhat researchers at PNNL discovered is that dendrites and whiskers originate in a structure known as the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI)—basically, where the solid lithium surface meets the liquid electrolyte, which is typically a film.\n\nThey also identified the culprit in the growth of these structures – ethylene carbonate, an indispensable solvent added to electrolytes to enhance battery performance. While it may be necessary to the function of the battery, it also leaves the battery vulnerable to damage, according to the researchers.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES:\tCoating Advances Lithium-Metal Battery Research\n\tPioneers of the Lithium-Ion Battery Awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\tFlexible Lithium Ion Battery Breakthrough\n\n\n\nTo achieve their result, the PNNL researchers had to capture the step-by-step process of what happens when a dendrite forms, which begins when lithium ions start to clump, or “nucleate,” on the surface of the anode. Like a stalagmite in a cave, the structure grows slowly as more and more lithium atoms attach to it.\n\nTo capture this growth process, scientists integrated an atomic force microscope (AFM) and an environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM). The latter is a high-performance instrument that allows scientists to study an operating battery under real conditions.\n\nThe researchers used the AFM to measure the tiny force of the whisker as it grew, pushing down on its tip with the cantilever of the AFM and measuring the force the dendrite exerted, they said.\n\nWhat they eventually discovered is that the more ethylene carbonate that they put in the electrolyte, the more the whiskers grew. The scientists experimented with the electrolyte mix, changing ingredients to try to reduce dendrite growth, with some positive results. The addition of cyclohexanone, for example, prevented the growth of dendrites and whiskers, researchers found.\n\nThe researchers hope that this new understanding of dendrite formation and growth will lead to new ideas for eliminating them, or at least controlling them to minimize damage. This could help pave the way for new and improved lithium-ion performance in next-generation devices and automobiles.\n\n“My hope is that our findings will spur the community to look at this problem in new ways,” Wang said in a press statement. “Clearly, more research is needed.”\n\nElizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer who has written about technology and culture for more than 20 years.

People are carrying it around – if you drop it or if you fall off it, that’s when it becomes damaged like anything else. If it’s internal, you don’t see it,” he says.\nIf the right safety measures are not put into practice, officials say the lithium-ion can become deadly.\n\"The problem is that if they’re overcharged…another issue you run into is when they charge them, if they lost a charger and buy a charger off line, it may not be the proper charger that’s designed for that battery,” Jandernal says.\nJandernal explains that many times buyers want to save some money and choose to get these products from a random store or from a non-reputable dealer. He says two years ago, he responded to a fire caused by a scooter purchased this way.\n“The scooter was not from a reputable company… Thankfully it was a small fire…the rug was on fire, actually, in their child’s room. And they were able to get the child out and call the fire department,” Jandernal says.\nAccording to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, at least 19 people died in the United States in 2022 because of fires or overheating incidents related to lithium-ion battery-powered products. The New York Fire Department reported at least 208 fires last year, resulting in 142 people injured and six dead.\nThe state of New Jersey currently does not have anything worked into the fire code regarding these types of products.\n“The state of New Jersey is working on adding requirements into the fire code to help us regulate where you can charge them, how you can charge them, where you can store them. It is a process and that’s coming,” Jandernal says.\nHe says that e-bikes and e-scooters should n to be charged inside bedrooms or near any combustible materials.\n“Charge them in the garage…if there is a fire and you have smoke detectors, you'll get a little warning and be a little more safe of being able to get everybody out of your house,” Jandernal says.\nJandernal says that the fire code cycle is usually between four or five years. He says the new code should be released soon.\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNewsletter\n\tSend Photos/Videos\n\tContact\n\tAbout Us\n\tNews 12 New York\n\n\tAltice USA\n\tOptimum\n\tCheddar News\n\tA4\n\tCareers\n\n\n\n\tPrivacy Policy\n\tTerms of Service\n\tAd Choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As noted previously, we all have smartphones and are reliant on them. Most of these phones easily can be used to navigate around town with the most updated technology.\n And yet, drivers want built-in navigation systems in their vehicles and are willing to pay for them despite the fact that — as Rocket Auto points out — “by the time the systems reach drivers, especially those purchasing used vehicles, they are often already outdated.”\n Related: 10 Types of Retirement Income That Are Not Taxable\n\n\n\nPartial automation is a wonder of today’s newer cars. But the technology has the potential to turn dangerous — and possibly deadly — because of how drivers are misusing it, according to necent research from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n The IIHS says drivers who regularly use partial automation too often lapse into treating their cars as if they were fully self-driving vehicles. That means they are more likely to eat, text and perform other potentially dangerous actions when behind the wheel.\n  As part of the study, about 600 drivers who use three types of partial automation were surveyed:\n \tCadillac Super Cruise\n\tNissan/Infiniti ProPILOT Assist\n\tTesla Autopilot\n\n For each of these technologies, a large percentage of drivers admitted to performing non-driving activities while using partial automation. In addition, 53% of Super Cruise users, 42% of Autopilot users and 12% of ProPILOT Assist users admitted to using their vehicles as if they were fully self-driving.\n A typical partial automation system has two features designed to help drivers when they are traveling on the highway:\n \tAdaptive cruise control. This technology helps the vehicle maintain a set speed while slowing down and speeding up to maintain an established distance to the cars ahead.\n\tLane centering. This technology uses steering support to keep a vehicle in the middle of the travel lane. More advanced systems can perform lane changes and other maneuvers.\n\n While these technologies can keep drivers safer, they may backfire when drivers expect too much out of them. According to the IIHS:\n “None of the current systems is designed to replace a human driver or to make it safe for a driver to perform other activities that take their focus away from the road. Track tests and real-world crashes have provided ample evidence that today’s partial automation systems struggle to recognize and react to many common driving situations and road features.”\n\n The data clearly shows that drivers who use ProPILOT Assist are significantly less likely to treat their vehicles as self-driving than those who used the other two partial automation systems.\n The IIHS speculated on possible reasons for this, including the fact that while the majority of Super Cruise and Autopilot owners were men, the breakdown among ProPILOT owners was more balanced between men and women.\n Age may also play a role, with most Super Cruise owners being older than 50 and many Autopilot owners being younger. Meanwhile, drivers using ProPILOT Assist were more evenly distributed across age ranges.\n Related: The Annuity Everyone Needs — and Anybody Can Get\n In a press release, David Harkey, IIHS president, also noted that while people who own cars with partial automation generally appear to “have a poor understanding of the technology’s limits” regardless of which system they use, it’s also possible that individual “system design and marketing are adding to these misconceptions.”\n  Sponsored: Add $1.7 million to your retirement\n A recent Vanguard study revealed a self-managed $500,000 investment grows into an average $1.7 million in 25 years.

The prosecutors have also enhanced the charges with allegations of domestic violence, as well as causing \"great bodily injury,\" according to court records.\n\"We do believe the evidence establishes the necessary intent to kill,\" Wagstaffe said at the arraignment, per the San Francisco Chronicle.\nDuring Patel's arraignment, he was behind a pane of glass that was not visible to the court room and only communicated with his attorney, Joshua Bentley, the news outlet said. His attorney requested a delay for the next court meeting till February  9, which was granted by the judge, court records show.\nThe attorney told the judge he's \"not certain\" Patel will be able to make it to a microphone due to \"serious lower body injuries,\" per the San Francisco Chronicle's report. The attorney said he was released from the hospital and moved to jail without bail on Friday and Waggstaffe said his wife was still in the hospital, per the San Francisco Chronicle. The judge had granted the request for no bail due to the \"potential danger to family members,\" the publication said.\nStory continues\nEarlier this month, Patel, his two children, and wife survived a 250-foot dive off a cliff known as Devil's Slide. The San Mateo County Sheriff's Office said in a tweet on January 2 that the children were \"unharmed\" at the time of rescue. NBC reported that the adults were taken to the hospital in critical condition upon recovery, but were later found to have sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\nAt the time of the incident, the family's survival was hailed as \"nothing short of a miracle.\" But, California Highway Patrol later said that \"Based on the evidence collected, investigators developed probable cause to believe this incident was an intentional act.\"\nWagstaffe said investigators are looking to rule out any issues with the car that could have caused the accident, but have yet to find any issues, The Los Angeles Times reported. The authorities had previously said that Tesla's driver assist features, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving do \"not appear to be a contributing factor in this incident.\"\nInsider was unable to contact Patel for comment ahead of publication, and his attorney did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication. The district attorney's office at San Mateo Court  and a spokesperson for Tesla also did not respond to a request for comment.\nRead San Francisco Chronicle's full report on the arraignment over at its website.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRENDING\n\n\t\nYahoo Life\nCan you become pregnant with an IUD?

Instead of reporting on January fires, I will wait until March to provide January and February’s data. This month, I have been hard at work on my annual report, which is scheduled to release in March and will include a breakdown of last year’s record number of fires and how to best solve the problem.  \n2022 In A Nutshell\n\n\nBased on recent media coverage, the world is finally catching up to the problem that we in the waste and recycling industry have known for years: Lithium-ion batteries are causing fires everywhere. In November 2022, the New York City Fire Department reported “191 fires, 140 injuries and six deaths from lithium-ion fires in the city.” Councilwoman Joann Ariola, chair of the Committee on Fire and Emergency Management, said the city is on track to more than double the number of lithium-ion battery-related fires.\nWhat took them so long? In 2017, based on my research, analysis and unique position on the frontlines with Fire Rover, I was forecasting a wave of lithium-ion battery fires in our waste streams due a number of factors. In 2018, we saw that bump on a global scale. From 2019 up until today, the waste and recycling industry’s leadership heard the call and took action to deal with these fires. These industrywide efforts included campaigns to educate the public on the dangers of lithium-ion batteries in the waste stream, operational best practices and the adoption of technologies like the Fire Rover.   \nWith all the hoopla surrounding lithium-ion batteries as the main culprit of fires, we cannot overlook the fact that in the waste and recycling industry, fire hazards are caused by several different factors. In fact, most of the data I have seen show that batteries are responsible for about half of the fires we see in our waste and recycling streams. Other factors like accelerants, pressurized tanks, explosives and more have long been causing fires at our waste and recycling operations and cannot be overlooked.  \nTHERE IS AN INHERENT RISK OF FIRES IN THE WASTE AND RECYCLING INDUSTRY! \nI do not make that statement lightly. The problem is not going away. In fact, the past two years have been our worst years for publicly reported fires since 2015. What is causing this to happen? In a nutshell, traditional hazards combined with the onslaught of batteries in our waste and recycling streams, worsening heat across the globe and a myriad of other factors continue to make operating in this space more dangerous. Additionally, as the world seeks to become “greener,” more stress is being placed on our waste and recycling infrastructure. Hazards that used to get thrown in a landfill or illegally dumped are now being handled properly, but in turn they are causing some negative effects on our infrastructure. So, in essence, the resulting increase in fires is a good problem to have for the globe, but dangerous, nonetheless.  \nThere are solutions to our fire problem. Many industries that have an inherent risk of fires in their operations have learned to safely operate within the constraints of their issues via education, operational best practices and investments in technology.   \nThere are many great folks who work on educating the public about proper recycling, some of whom are highlighted in my report. In 2022, I started highlighting the problem on our Fire Rover TikTok channel. Why? To properly educate the public on the dangers of improper recycling. We need to educate the public when they are young and where can we meet them on their level. Read through some of the comments in our posts and you will soon see the realities of how hard it will be to educate our way out of this problem.  \nI strongly believe our waste and recycling operators are the unintended victims in the lithium-ion battery supply chain. It is only fair that some of the costs of these fire hazards, which, in my estimation, cost more than $1.2 billion dollars in the U.S. and Canada, should be borne by the manufacturers of the batteries as opposed to the operators, insurance companies and municipal fire departments. Who do you think is footing that bill? The operators, their insurance companies and fire professionals who are responding to these incidents. It’s only fair that the manufacturers be held responsible and foot at least some of the bill. \nFire departments are traditionally underfunded, and more than half of the fire professionals in the U.S. are volunteer. Specifically, there are “1,134,400 firefighters in the United States…[o]f these, 346,150 (31%) are career and 788,250 (69%) are volunteer.” The point is our fire departments deserve some funding for training and equipment to fight EV battery fires, transfer station fires, scrap metal fires and other fire incidents that may occur. The waste and recycling operators deserve the same when it comes to solutions like the Fire Rover that have proven they are a requirement when the uncontrollable risks that are inherent in your business are causing fires. \nI have heard some faint discussion regarding insurance companies that are looking for the manufacturers to cover some of their losses after they have occurred. But what if we took a proactive approach to solving this problem and started holding the manufacturers responsible for providing the equipment, technology and training needed to combat the fire problem we currently face.\nNOT HAVE A MAJOR FIRE INCIDENT.  \n\n\n\nFire is not the problem until it becomes the problem. Early on in my industry tenure, I kept hearing the same thing, “Fire grows in size and scope every X seconds/minutes.”  Put in whatever compounding factor you want, but the reality is the earlier you catch a fire, the better chance you have at mitigating the risk to employees, fire professionals, operations and physical infrastructure.  \n\nRyan Fogelman\n\n\nSo, what does that really mean?  \nPrevention: It’s the operator’s job to follow best practices to minimize a fire.  \nInternal Response: Outside of a fire brigade, the operators must train their employees on best practices such as when it is safe for them to respond and when they must evacuate. In addition, they should invest in solutions like the Fire Rover that detect the fire early with thermal cameras, optical flame and smoke detectors; eliminate the need for a response when the situation warrants; and can engage the fire professionals when warranted. \nProfessional Response: Arming and equipping our fire professionals with the proper tools, training, techniques and education to successfully fight these types of fire hazards.  \nSuccessfully fighting fire problems on a long-term basis requires a combination of all parties working together in lockstep and ready to respond when and if the situation arises. Since no two fire incidences are the same, no two responses are the same, which is why we need a framework that allows for flexibility, quick thinking and proper actions to ensure if an operator has a fire incident that it is not “major” or “catastrophic.” \nIn 2022, my team at Fire Rover was responsible for more than 1,500 saves at our 350-plus client operations. We have never had a catastrophic incident that began in an area that we protect. Are we perfect? No, but we have successfully fought any major incident that we faced with minimal damage to any of our clients’ facilities. We currently protect eight of the top ten waste and recycling companies in the country along with family-owned operations, municipalities and corporations in the U.S., Canada, the UK, France and Australia. Is it always pretty? No, sometimes it is downright ugly, but our results speak for themselves. The fact is “fire” is ugly. The same two incidents rarely happen twice and never in the same exact way. You have to prepare for the unknown and react within seconds to overcome constantly changing factors and challenges.  \nEven with our performance, 2022 was the highest year for reported waste and recycling facilities fires that we have experienced since I began consolidating the data in 2016. We even beat last year’s record, which I incorrectly thought was our high-water line.  \nWhy is this number significant? We know the number of batteries we use in personal electronics and personal storage equipment is only growing. I previously made the statement that 2021’s high number of reported incidents was possibly due to 2020’s pullback during the COVID-19 pandemic. The assumption is the waste and recycling tonnage slowed down in 2020 and was pushed into 2021.  \n\n \nWhat we learned in 2022 was that not only is the lithium-ion battery hazard on the rise in our waste and recycling facilities, but it is starting to garner major public attention outside of our space. Batteries are catching fire on airplanes, in EVs, in high-rise buildings, in scooters and more. This has caused the media to finally focus on the problem, which is both a blessing and a curse. In reality, lithium-ion batteries are a relatively safe technology. According to Victoria Hutchison, a research project manager at the Fire Protection Research Foundation, “One out of every 10 million lithium-ion batteries fails, a condition that almost always leads to a fire.” The issue is that batteries that are treated improperly, incorrectly charged or made with substandard parts/materials are the ones that burn. Just like the public is hard on their electronic scooters by hitting corners, jumping on and off sidewalk curbs and charging 20 at a time, the waste and recycling industry is hard on its trash. Unless someone can figure out a way to be gentler with our waste and recycling, the industry deserves some resources to stop the public’s bad recycling behavior and resources to help deal with the inherent risk thrust upon them.  \nThe best practice of “water, water, water,” which is a fire response approach used for hundreds if not thousands of years, is evolving into early detection and immediate response. Lowering the risk of catastrophic incidents through operational, technological and professional best practices puts the waste and recycling industry in a good position to stem the tide over the next couple of years, even with the onslaught of hazards continuing to barrage our waste and recycling streams across the globe.   \nConclusion\nAs I finalize the 6th edition of the \"Waste & Recycling Facility Fires Annual Report,\" I look forward to breaking down the hazards of the different incidents by material, state, tonnage and more with the ultimate goal of finding new trends or learnings from these incidents.

The electric vehicle maker’s stock was down 2.2% ahead of the open, after running up 24.4% amid an 8-day win streak through Thursday, and after soaring 63.0% over a 15-day stretch in which it gained 14 times. The 8-day win streak was the longest since the 8-day streak that ended July 22, 2022. The stock’s pullback comes as part of a selloff in the broader stock market, as futures    for the S&P 500    fell 0.7%. CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson raised late Thursday his stock price target to $250 from $210, but lowered his rating to buy from strong buy, saying the “dramatic rebound” to start the year have led him to be a bit less bullish.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGo to MSN Home\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n     \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n \n \n \n\n More from Marketwatch\n \n\n\n \n\t\n\n \n\n  U.S. stocks trade mostly lower, S&P 500 heads for worst week since December\n \n \n MarketWatch\n\n\n\n                        \n\n                    \n                \n\t\n\n \n\n  Is Rihanna the first billionaire to perform at a Super Bowl halftime show?\n \n \n MarketWatch\n\n\n\n                        \n\n                    \n                \n\t\n\n \n\n  'High-altitude object' downed over Alaska within the last hour: White House\n \n \n MarketWatch\n\n\n\n                        \n\n                    \n                \n\n\n         \n            \n                \n                   \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    MarketWatch\n                \n\n                \n                    \n                       View the full site\n                    \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\nHome\n\n\t\nNews\n\n\t\nWeather\n\n\t\nEntertainment\n\n\t\nMoney\n\n\t\nSports\n\n\t\nEsports\n\n\t\nLifestyle\n\n\t\nShopping\n\n\t\nBuy a car\n\n\t\nHealth & Fitness\n\n\t\nFood & Drink\n\n\t\nTravel\n\n\t\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n © 2023 Microsoft\n Privacy & Cookies\n Terms of use\n About our Ads\n Feedback\n Help\n MSN Blog\n About Us\n Editorial Standards\n Your California Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n \n     \n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n \n",

He was pronounced dead at Elmhurst Hospital. Two men and a woman were also taken to Elmhurst in stable condition, police said.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the men, Henry Corona, 45, told The Post he heard “exploding noises” and “thought they were gunshots,” adding he ran outside and saw his mother “fall to the floor from the second story” yelling, ‘I’m dying! I’m dying!’”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nAn unidentified man in his 60s died of smoke inhalation.Christopher Sadowski\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘No you’re not’ and pulled her out,” said Corona, who cut his hand breaking a glass window.\n\n\n\n\n“I was trying to save the dogs, I couldn’t feel anything but rage, I punched and punched and sliced my hand all the way down.”\n\n\n\n\nCorona’s niece, Heidi Abreu, 22, who used to live at the home, identified the dead man as her uncle. She believed there were two fires, including one started by the charging e-bike battery in the first-floor hallway. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nMore than 100 firefighters and EMS personnel responded to the two-alarm blaze.Christopher Sadowski\n\n\n\n“The water wouldn’t come out of the fire hydrant, I was just watching the house burn because the water didn’t want to come out,” Abreu sobbed. She said the family had three dogs, a pit bull, who is now staying with a neighbor and two chihuahuas, who had not been immediately accounted for.\n\n\n\n\nThree civilians and four firefighters also suffered minor injuries, officials said. Two firefighters were treated at NY-Presbyterian Hospital, Queens, and two went to Elmhurst Hospital.\n\n\n\n\nMore than 100 firefighters and EMS personnel responded to the two-alarm blaze, which was deemed under control at 12:40 a.m. Saturday, the FDNY said. \n\n\n\n\nE-bikes and other lithium-ion battery-powered mobility devices have become all the rage. But many people store and charge e-bike batteries in their apartments, which “present serious fire safety hazards,” officials said.\n\n\n\n\nFires caused by e-bike batteries killed six people in 2022, officials said. It was a lithium battery that was blamed for a fire in College Point, Queens, in September that left an 8-year-old girl dead and two adults seriously injured. Fire officials said an electric scooter battery caused the blaze.\n\n\n\n\nFriday’s deadly Queens fire is believed to be the first such e-bike battery-related blaze of the new year, records show.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tShare this

While being hammered on the social media site he owns, Tesla, perhaps Musk’s most famous endeavour, haemorraged its stock value. Over the course of the year, Tesla stock fell by around 70%. Tesla won the dubious prize of the worst performing stock of 2022 for a major tech company.\nDespite the general woes of the markets, Tesla stock is down nearly 30 percent since its CEO acquired the social media platform. In that same period, other major car manufacturers have seen their stock rise slightly. Stock isn’t the be all and end all of a companies strengths however, but investors who have committed a lot of money to what has been one of Wall Street’s safest investments will want a return.\n“I think he really needs to focus on operations, focus on giving us great cars,” said Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin.\nDan Ives, Wedbush Securities writes, “At the same time that Tesla is cutting prices and inventory is starting to build globally in face of a likely global recession, Musk is viewed as ‘asleep at the wheel’ from a leadership perspective.”\nWith Musk stepping down as Twitter CEO, at least that’s his claim, investors will be hoping for a return to some quiet management.\nSelf-driving car continues to be safety nightmares\nWhile stocks in the company have been falling rapidly another pressing problem, especially for the public, has been the wealth of crashs that can be attributed to Tesla’s self-driving software. While Musk was lauding the self-driving beta being rolled-out on 24 November, 2022, a family was involved in a crash apparently caused by the abrupt stop of their self-driving Tesla, causing nine injuries.\nI obtained surveillance footage of the self-driving Tesla that abruptly stopped on the Bay Bridge, resulting in an eight-vehicle crash that injured 9 people including a 2 yr old child just hours after Musk announced the self-driving feature.\n\nFull story: https://t.co/LaEvX9TzxW pic.twitter.com/i75jSh2UpN\n— Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) January 10, 2023\n\n\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, has said that it is launching an investigation into the incident. Tesla vehicles using its “Autopilot” driver assistance system were involved in 273 known crashes from July 2021 to June of last year, according to NHTSA data.\nAt present there are no federal restrictions on the testing of self-driving cars making the proliferation of such tests a danger for the public.\n\nUS NEWS\nHow did Elon Musk lose $200bn in a year?\n\n\n\n\nBUSINESS\nMusk on Tesla crash\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTagged in:\n\tTesla Motors\n\tMuertes\n\tElon Musk\n\n\n\nWe recommend you in Latest news\tBREAKING NEWSUS shoots down ‘high-altitude object’ in Alaska\n\tFINANCIAL NEWSCan waiting to file tax returns as recommended by the IRS affect your 2023 refund?\n\tHEALTHY FOODSFood that improves memory\n\tCLIMATE NEWSFoods that may not exist in 2050\n\tFINANCIAL NEWSThe new limit for Gift Tax: how much will the IRS take from me if I receive more money?\n\tSOCIAL SECURITYSocial Security double payment in March: who qualifies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuscribe to our newsletters\n\tAS - Daily News\n\tWeekend Schedule\n\tShowroom\n\nSubscribe\nMost viewed\n\t1\nFINANCIAL NEWS\nRelief checks 2023: Which states will send payments of up to $1,050 in February?\n\n\n\n\n\t2\nFinancial assistance\nStimulus checks for inflation relief, February 2023: which states pay and how much\n\n\n\n\n\t3\nLATEST NEWS\nPentagon reveals the contents of Chinese balloon\n\n\n\n\n\nMore news\n\n\nDAZN\nEnjoy live and on-demand online sports on DAZN.

So when the battery overheated and started the fire, it blocked the egress out of the apartment trapping the family.”\n\n\n\n\nTwo people escaped the blaze and were able to run past the battery, which was being charged, and out into a hallway. The bike was not attached to the battery at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tPrevious\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1 of 5\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tNext\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdvertisement\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFlames tore through a fifth-floor apartment at 165 Sherman Ave. in Inwood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Sadowski\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThree children and one adult were injured.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Sadowski\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdvertisement\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA lithium ion battery is believed to have caused the fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Sadowski\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdvertisement\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsposito said firefighters, who responded to the scene in under 3 minutes, had to break down the apartment door because it had locked behind two residents who escaped. The apartment also had no smoke detectors, he said. \n\n\n\n\nThe victims’ names, ages and genders were not released.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFires caused by e-bike batteries killed six people in the city in 2022, officials said. A lithium battery was blamed for a fire in College Point, Queens, in September that left an 8-year-old girl dead and two adults seriously injured. Fire officials said an electric-scooter battery caused the blaze.  \n\n\n\n\n“We try to remind all New Yorkers about the dangers of these lithium ion batteries,” Esposito said. “We should not be charging them overnight. We should not be charging them in the path of egress from the apartment. A suggestion would be to charge them while you’re awake in a room that nobody is in with the door closed.” \n\n\n\n\nThe rate at which a battery fire spreads also poses a challenge.\n\n\n\n\n“It doesn’t smolder,” Esposito said. “It goes from zero to 100 very, very quickly, in seconds.”\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tShare this article:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFacebook\n\tTwitter\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFlipboard\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\tWhatsApp\n\tEmail\n\tCopy\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFiled under\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbatteries\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfdny\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfires\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bronx\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2/5/23\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRead Next\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEx-NY Gov.

He was charged with one felony count of possession for sale of a controlled substance and one misdemeanor count of battery.\n\n\n\n\nGascón’s office asked a judge this week to lock up Radimak, who was described as a flight risk and a danger to the community based on “his lengthy criminal history which spans nearly two decades and crosses multiple states and jurisdictions.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nIn November 2022, Radimak was accused of threatening to attack a woman at a storage facility.\n\n\n\nIn granting the prosecutors’ request to jail Radimak pending the outcome of his case, the presiding judge said that since 2004, the defendant has had run-ins with the law in eight different states, reported ABC7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadimak is being held on bail topping $5.1 million. He is due back in court for a preliminary hearing on Feb. 14. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tShare this

According to a January 25 letter sent to California Public Utilities Commission by the city's transportation authority, there were at least \"92 unique incidents reported to the City between May 29, and December 31, 2022,\" involving Cruise autonomous vehicles.\n\n\n\n\nOther incidents involved Cruise vehicles blocking intersections, bus lanes, and light-rail tracks, according to the Chronicle, as well as several near misses that could've easily ended in a collision.\nState regulators are currently considering whether Cruise is allowed to start charging for rides in San Francisco without any geolocation restrictions. As of right now, the General Motors-owned company can charge fares in roughly a third of the city's streets between 10 am and 6 pm.\nCompetitor Waymo also received permission last year to start testing driverless cars in the Bay Area city and is applying for permits to charge fares as well.\nDespite the dozens of incidents, Cruise claims it has a proven safety record after covering \"millions of miles in an extremely complex urban environment with zero life-threatening injuries or fatalities,\" as one spokesperson told the Chronicle.\n\n\n\n\nOfficials, however, faced with a growing problem, are worried about future incidents, that not only could disrupt bus and rail services, but pose a real risk to residents as well.\nREAD MORE: Self-driving cars are causing mayhem on S.F. streets, officials say.

Ducharme\nFebruary 9, 2023, 1:04 PM·4 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.” - Albert Einstein\nA recent item came to my attention that I thought I might share with you. E-bikes and escooters are becoming more and more common. If you haven’t yet seen one in your condominium association you likely will soon. They can save a lot of environmental wear and tear, are faster than walking to work, and still provide a lot of exercise (with help for the tired or those going uphill), but there is also a downside. They catch on fire. Not often. But when they do, the fires tend to be explosive and particularly dangerous.\nMost condominium associations are made up of units that have shared walls, and sometimes shared floors and ceilings. They are, to put it simply, very close together. Most of these associations also have allowances for the storage of bicycles, e-bikes, e-scooters and more, either on a back deck, in a basement storage area, and if neither of those are available, owners are forced to store them inside their Unit.\nUsually there is not a large problem with theft of these items because of one of these three storage area options. But the problem here is not theft, but fires, and not just any fires, but a lot of them, by one report at least 200 e-bike fires and six deaths in New York City alone in 2022, from a very unexpected place.\n\n\nE-bikes and e-scooters are powered by lithium-ion batteries. They are now in almost every facet of our lives, such as phones, laptops, toothbrushes, vaping devices, hover boards, tools, electric vehicles, electric scooters, wireless headphones, hearing aids and more.\nThe problem is, when an old or otherwise failing lithium-ion battery overheats, it can violently eject gas, projectiles and flames, by some estimates a flame of up to 60’ lighting everything in its way. This, of course, can spread like a chain reaction to other, nearby cells, so if many e-bikes, for example, are stored in the basement of a condominium and one goes, the chances of all igniting and creating a fireball are very good, and very bad for the condominium association and those in it.\nStory continues\nResearch shows that by unofficial estimates (there is no central repository for lithium-ion battery fires) only one out of every 10 million lithium ion batteries fails and causes an explosive fire. That may seem like a slim chance, but if people take a chance on one in 300 million winning Powerball ticket, an association should probably be at lest a bit concerned about a one in 10 million chance of damage, destruction or worse.\nWhy is this a concern at condominium associations? Because of the closeness of Units. If you have a fire in a single-family home, as truly tragic as that can be, it is nowhere near the level of tragedy and property loss that would occur in a closely packed condominium association. Just ask those in New York City who suffered such a lithium-ion fire.\nWhat to do? Ask owners to ensure they buy batteries and devices that have been certified by UL Solutions or another testing laboratory. And always use only chargers that are compatible with the battery, i.e. one recommended by the manufacturer. If not, the battery might well continue to charge to the point of overheating.\nWhat to look out for in your lithium ion battery item? Two clues are that things take longer to charge or that charges don’t last as long once charged. Both of these problems indicate the battery is working harder than it should and possibly overheating bringing you and your association one step closer to a real problem.\nIf that happens, it’s time to change the battery, and quickly. Immediately before failure, and this is where the problems arise, a battery will make a popping noise and then a hiss, which is voluble gas being release. If it hits anything combustible fear will transform into danger into damage and possibly worse very, very quickly.\nAs our parents used to tell us, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. I would not advise any condominium association to start regulating e-mobility devices, but it would not hurt to explain the concern at your annual meeting every year or two and ask owners to be aware of the risk, if not for themselves, but for their neighbors, friends and family.\nHere are links to a Consumer Reports article and to the New York Times article that originally caught my eye, for those who might be a bit more interested.

Jonathan Darr of the fire department's Hazardous Materials Unit at a recent news conference held at the Kakaako Fire Station.\nA chemical reaction called \"thermal runaway\" occurs when the lithium-ion battery cells enters an uncontrollable self-heating state, Darr said.\nFire officials say thermal runaway can cause the battery to reach extremely high temperatures and produce a lot of toxic, flammable gases that may appear as white smoke.\n\n\n\"This could result in intense fires,\" Darr said.\n\"For example, if a battery is overheating and you notice an odor or a change in shape or color or leaking or odd noises from the device, then it's possible the device is going into thermal runaway,\" he added. If possible, move that item away from anything that could catch fire and call 911.\nThe fire department recommends charging devices with lithium-ion batteries outside of the home or in well-ventilated areas.\nSome of the causes of thermal runaway are defective or damaged batteries and overcharging.\nIn November, a fire broke out at a Monte Street home in Kalihi after an electric bike being charged in a bedroom caught fire. The bedroom was also used as a storage room.\nHonolulu firefighter Kamehalani Ortiz, who investigated the fire, said the e-bike was surrounded by clothes and other combustibles. \"Once that ignited, it started a chain reaction that was very difficult to stop.\"\nFive people who were in the home at the time safely escaped the fire after smoke detectors alerted them of the blaze.\nThe cause of the fire was determined to be accidental due to thermal runaway of a lithium-ion battery in the e-bike. Damage to the home and its contents was estimated at more than $170,000.\nStory continues\nFrom January 2020 to Dec. 12, the fire department reported 386 building or structure fires. Of that figure, 167 were accidental fires, 58 of which were caused by lithium-ion batteries..\nExperts recommend e-bike owners to not leave an e-bike unattended while it's charging. Also, follow the manufacturer's instructions for charging and storage and do not leave it charging overnight.\n\"Just having an ounce of prevention is going to save everybody a pound of pain,\" Ortiz said at the news conference.\nThe Honolulu Fire Department provided the following lithium-ion battery safety tips:\n>> When purchasing devices, make sure it has the Underwriters Laboratories mark which shows the product has been safely tested\n>> Follow the manufacturer's instructions for charging and storage. Always use the cord and power adapter made specifically for the device.\n>> Do not charge a device under your pillow, on your bed or near combustibles.\n>> Keep batteries/devices at room temperature. Do not place in direct sunlight\n>> Store batteries away from anything flammable.\n>> Do not throw loose lithium-ion batteries in the trash. HFD recommends contacting the Honolulu Department of Environmental Services' Refuse Division at 808-768-3201 for proper disposal.

It might depend whether or not there's a car involved, according to a new study from UK researchers. They showed that people have a shared 'blind spot' that can make them use different moral and ethical standards when they think about driving cars, compared to other areas of life.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n         \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\n\nThe researchers from Swansea University and the University of the West of England commissioned an independent polling organization to ask 2,157 people across the UK a series of questions. Randomly, each person got a set of questions that asked about driving cars or an identical set of questions with one or two words changed so that they asked about the same underlying principles, but didn't mention driving.\n\nThe results showed that people could go from agreeing with an idea to disagreeing with it simply based on whether it was framed as a driving issue or not. For example, 75% of the UK public agreed \"People shouldn't smoke in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe in the cigarette fumes,\" but only 17% agreed when two words were changed so that the statement was \"People shouldn't drive in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe in the car fumes.\"\n\n\"It is nonsensical to say that making people breathe toxic air is a problem when it comes from a cigarette, but making people breathe toxic air is fine when it comes from a car,\" said Professor Ian Walker from Swansea University. \"The underlying principle is the same, but people in our study were not using the same standards when they judged the two things.\"\n\n\"We saw something similar when it came to theft. If you leave your 'belongings' in the street and they get stolen, only 37% of people think the police should do something about it. But if you leave your 'car' in the street and it gets stolen then 87% of people think the police should take action—even though the car is really just one of your belongings.\"\n\n\"These huge differences came from changing just one or two words in the questions. It's long been suspected that people can slip unconsciously into using different standards when they think about driving, leading them to commit a fallacy known as 'special pleading.' Our study was intended to reveal this phenomenon and show just how substantial these effects can be.\"\n\nA particular reason this matters, say the team, is that it's not just the general public who have unconscious biases around motoring—it's also politicians and members of the medical profession who influence public health.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  When a policymaker automatically assumes that traveling from one place to another is going to involve driving, they might harm public health by trying to make driving easier. In this case, their blind spot might create policies that increase air pollution and make travel more difficult and dangerous for all the people who move by other means—or who might like to.\n\n\"If you asked a politician whether a new hospital should be inaccessible to one-fifth of the population, obviously they'd say no,\" said Professor Alan Tapp, of the University of the West of England. \"Whereas if you asked that same politician whether a hospital should be built on the edge of town, it's likely that many wouldn't see the problem, if they have a form of this mindset we're looking at. But in practice, having the hospital outside town is not that different from making it inaccessible when a fifth of households don't have a car.\"\n\n\"We regularly see policy decisions—from the location of amenities to the design of streets—that overlook the needs of people who aren't driving, often forcing these people to make longer journeys or place themselves in danger for the convenience of people who are driving. We suggest that these shared assumptions demonstrated in our study, which we called 'motonormativity,' are a big part of the reason that such problems don't get noticed.\"\n\nIn their paper \"Motonormativity: How social norms hide a major public health hazard,\" the team say that we are all surrounded by environments that promote motor travel and systematically downplay the negative consequences. These environments range from pelican crossings that make pedestrians wait for permission to cross the road while drivers automatically get a green light, to advertising and media that normalize and excuse antisocial and dangerous driving.\n\n\"If all you've ever known is a world where the needs of motorists come first, there's a good chance you're going to start to understand that is the 'normal' or even the 'proper' way of things,\" said Dr. Adrian Davis, also from the University of the West of England.\n\n\"We saw evidence of that here. When we pulled out just the people in our survey who didn't drive, we saw that even these people were using different standards when the questions asked about driving. Their answers tended to echo what the drivers were saying, meaning it's not even simple self-interest at work. It's got to be something deeper, rooted in our culture.\"\n\nThe researchers end their report by calling on decision makers to start recognizing their unconscious biases on this topic, and to put in place systems to make transport decision-making more rational.\n\n\"Every decision maker needs to get used to asking themselves 'What's the underlying principle we're considering here, and would I still be happy with it if we were talking about something other than road transport?'\" said Professor Walker. \"Perhaps then we might stop doing things that are currently commonplace but actually really problematic when you think about them in more abstract terms, like teaching children they have a responsibility to protect themselves from adults who might hurt them.\"\n\nThe study is to be published in the International Journal of Environment and Health.

He has a criminal history dating nearly 20 years and spanning several states, officials said.\n In Southern California, he’s accused of attacks on motorists dating to January 2020, prosecutors said.\n On Jan. 11 of this year, he allegedly used a pipe to hit two cars, one on an LA-area freeway and the other after following a couple from a shopping mall in Pasadena, prosecutors said.\n More Law&Crime Coverage: 78-Year-Old Grandma Accused of Helping Grandson Cover Up Murder: Police\n In November, Radimak allegedly threatened two women and broke one of their car’s headlights. In June he allegedly threatened a 74-year-old woman outside a doctor’s office in Glendale, prosecutors said. Glendale is about 7 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.\n He had already been facing drug possession and battery charges from an attack in Hollywood in January 2020 when officials said they found steroids and more than $30,000 in his car, officials said.\nThe post ‘Reign of Terror Ends Today’: Tesla Driver Charged in Multiple Road-Rage Attacks: Prosecutors first appeared on Law & Crime.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGo to MSN Home\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n     \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n \n \n \n\n More from Law & Crime\n \n\n\n \n\t\n\n \n\n  Estranged husband charged, 2nd man sought in death of New Jersey kindergarten teacher whose beaten, strangled body found in shallow grave\n \n \n Law & Crime\n\n\n\n                        \n\n                    \n                \n\t\n\n \n\n  South Carolina dog breeder fatally shot during French bulldog exchange\n \n \n Law & Crime\n\n\n\n                        \n\n                    \n                \n\t\n\n \n\n  DNA under young mom’s broken fingernail will lock rapist and murderer up for life 40 years after initial jurors failed to convict\n \n \n Law & Crime\n\n\n\n                        \n\n                    \n                \n\n\n         \n            \n                \n                   \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Law & Crime\n                \n\n                \n                    \n                       View Site\n                    \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\nHome\n\n\t\nNews\n\n\t\nWeather\n\n\t\nEntertainment\n\n\t\nMoney\n\n\t\nSports\n\n\t\nEsports\n\n\t\nLifestyle\n\n\t\nShopping\n\n\t\nBuy a car\n\n\t\nHealth & Fitness\n\n\t\nFood & Drink\n\n\t\nTravel\n\n\t\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n © 2023 Microsoft\n Privacy & Cookies\n Terms of use\n About our Ads\n Feedback\n Help\n MSN Blog\n About Us\n Editorial Standards\n Your California Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n \n     \n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n \n",

According to a January 25 letter sent to California Public Utilities Commission by the city's transportation authority, there were at least \"92 unique incidents reported to the City between May 29, and December 31, 2022,\" involving Cruise autonomous vehicles.\n\n\n\n\nOther incidents involved Cruise vehicles blocking intersections, bus lanes, and light-rail tracks, according to the Chronicle, as well as several near misses that could've easily ended in a collision.\nState regulators are currently considering whether Cruise is allowed to start charging for rides in San Francisco without any geolocation restrictions. As of right now, the General Motors-owned company can charge fares in roughly a third of the city's streets between 10 am and 6 pm.\nCompetitor Waymo also received permission last year to start testing driverless cars in the Bay Area city and is applying for permits to charge fares as well.\nDespite the dozens of incidents, Cruise claims it has a proven safety record after covering \"millions of miles in an extremely complex urban environment with zero life-threatening injuries or fatalities,\" as one spokesperson told the Chronicle.\n\n\n\n\nOfficials, however, faced with a growing problem, are worried about future incidents, that not only could disrupt bus and rail services, but pose a real risk to residents as well.\nREAD MORE: Self-driving cars are causing mayhem on S.F. streets, officials say.

Super-resolution electron microscopy combined with deep machine learning enabled the UCI-led team to decipher minute changes at the interface of materials sandwiched together in lithium-ion batteries.\n\n“We are particularly interested in nickel, as it can help us transition away from cobalt as a cathode material,” said co-author Huolin Xin, UCI professor of physics and astronomy. “Cobalt is toxic, so it’s dangerous to mine and handle, and it’s often extracted under socially repressive conditions in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo.”\n\nBut for the change to be fully realized, battery developers need to know what goes on inside the cells as they are repeatedly discharged and recharged. The high energy density of nickel-layered lithium-ion batteries has been found to cause rapid chemical and mechanical breakdown of LIBs’ component materials.\n\nThe team used a transmission electron microscope and atomistic simulations to learn how oxidation phase transitions impact battery materials, causing imperfections in an otherwise fairly uniform surface.\n\n“This project, which relied heavily on some of the world’s most powerful microscopy technologies and advanced data science approaches, clears the way for the optimization of high-nickel-content lithium-ion batteries,” Xin said. “Knowing how these batteries operate at the atomic scale will help engineers develop LIBs with vastly improved power and life cycles.”\n\nFunded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the project relied on facilities at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, and the UC Irvine Materials Research Institute. Paper co-authors included Chunyang Wang, UCI postdoctoral scholar in physics and astronomy; Tianjiao Lei, UCI postdoctoral scholar in materials science and engineering; and Kim Kisslinger and Xuelong Wang of Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tUniversity of California Irvine\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 0\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFacebookTwitterGoogle+ReddItWhatsAppPinterestEmail\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiednewsdesk\n\n\t\t\t\t\t45951 posts\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t0 comments\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Prev Post\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tUniversity of California Irvine researchers find how human brains turn into smarter disease fighters\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNext Post \n\n\t\t\t\tUniversity of California Irvine’s online criminology master’s program ranked number 1\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tYou might also like\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMore from author\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInternational News\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArizona International hosts Dr. TV Nagendra Prasad, Consul General of India to the…\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAustralia Education\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDarshan Shelat, a student pursuing Masters in IT and Systems at the University of…\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInternational News\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tADB Issues First Gender Bond in Georgia’s Domestic Capital Market\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInternational News\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSustainable Trade and Investment Key to Asia and Pacific’s Green Future\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prev\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNext \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tLeave A Reply\n Cancel Reply\nYour email address will not be published.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t© 2023 - India Education | Latest Education News  | Global Educational News | Recent Educational News.

[+] Street. April 07, 2021 in Walsall, England. A two-week-old baby boy, Ciaran Lee Morris, was killed when a motorist mounted the sidewalk and struck his pram pinning it and the baby's mother, Codie Holyman, to a wall in Brownhills on Sunday afternoon. West Midlands Police arrested 34-year-old James Paul Davis in Bloxwich shortly afterwards. He appeared in court charged with causing death by driving while uninsured, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and failure to report a collision. (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\nA British study has discovered that humans have an in-built acceptance of the risks and harms from motorists that they would not accept in other parts of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling this car blindness “motonormativity,” the researchers from Swansea University and the University of the West of England believe these unconscious biases have policy implications.\n\n\n\nWhen a policymaker assumes that traveling from one place to another will involve driving, they might harm public health by trying to make driving easier, says the team.\n\n\n\nThis blind spot might create policies that increase air pollution and make travel more difficult and dangerous for all the people who move by other means.\n\n\n\n“If you asked a politician whether a new hospital should be inaccessible to one-fifth of the population, obviously they’d say no,” said Professor Alan Tapp of the University of the West of England.\n\n\n\n“Whereas if you asked that same politician whether a hospital should be built on the edge of town, it’s likely that many wouldn’t see the problem if they have a form of this mindset we’re looking at.\n\n“But in practice, having the hospital outside town is not that different from making it inaccessible when a fifth of households don’t have a car.\n\n“We regularly see policy decisions—from the location of amenities to the design of streets—that overlook the needs of people who aren’t driving, often forcing them to make longer journeys or place themselves in danger for the convenience of people who are driving. We suggest that these shared assumptions demonstrated in our study, which we called ‘motonormativity’, are a big part of the reason that such problems don’t get noticed.”\n\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\nBest Travel Insurance Companies\nByAmy Danise\nEditor\n\n\nBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans\nByAmy Danise\nEditor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy co-author Professor Ian Walker from Swansea University added:\n\n“It is nonsensical to say that making people breathe toxic air is a problem when it comes from a cigarette, but it is fine when it comes from a car. The underlying principle is the same, but people in our study were not using the same standards when they judged the two things.\n\n\n\n“We saw something similar when it came to theft. If you leave your’ belonging in the street and they get stolen, only 37% of people think the police should do something about it. But if you leave your car in the street and it gets stolen, then 87% of people think the police should take action—even though the car is just one of your belongings.\n\n\n\n“It’s long been suspected that people can slip unconsciously into using different standards when they think about driving, leading them to commit a fallacy known as special pleading. Our study was intended to reveal this phenomenon and show just how substantial these effects can be,” said Walker.\n\nThese differences came from changing just one or two words in the questions asked of study participants. An independent polling company carried out the questioning with 2,157 members of the public.\n\nRandomly, each person got a set of questions about driving cars or an identical set of questions with one or two words changed so that they asked about the same underlying principles but didn’t mention driving.\n\nPeople could go from agreeing with an idea to disagreeing with it based on whether or not it was framed as a driving issue.\n\nFor example, 75% of those asked agreed, ‘People shouldn’t smoke in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe in the cigarette fumes,’ but only 17% agreed when two words were changed so that the statement was ‘People shouldn’t drive in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe in the car fumes.’\n\nA crash-damaged black Ford Focus which was found abandoned after two brothers aged six and two died ... [+] after a suspected hit-and-run incident on February 22, 2018 in Coventry, England.  (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n“If all you’ve ever known is a world where the needs of motorists come first, there’s a good chance you’re going to start to understand that is the ‘normal’ or even the ‘proper’ way of things,” said study co-author Dr. Adrian Davis, also from the University of the West of England.\n\n“When we pulled out just the people in our survey who didn’t drive, we saw that even these people were using different standards when the questions asked about driving. Their answers tended to echo what the drivers were saying, meaning it’s not even simple self-interest at work. It’s got to be something deeper, rooted in our culture.”\n\nIn their paper ‘Motonormativity: How social norms hide a major public health hazard,’ the team says that we are all surrounded by environments that promote motor travel and systematically downplay the negative consequences. These environments range from pelican crossings that make pedestrians wait for permission to cross the road while drivers automatically get a green light to advertising and media that normalize and excuse antisocial and dangerous driving.\n\nThe researchers say decision-makers should start recognizing their unconscious biases on this topic and implement systems to make transport decision-making more rational.\n\n“Every decision maker needs to get used to asking themselves, ‘What’s the underlying principle we’re considering here, and would I still be happy with it if we were talking about something other than road transport?’” said Professor Walker.\n\n“There are many dimensions to our dependence on the car relating to social practices, infrastructure, the political economy, and so on,” agreed Dr. Giulio Mattioli of the Urban Development Research Group at Germany’s TU Dortmund University, who was not involved with the study but called it “enlightening.”\n\n“This interesting paper sheds light on the more cognitive dimension of car dependence, which is equally important,” said Mattioli.\n\n“A key reason why many people still support car-dependent transport systems is that they see them as natural, inevitable and without alternatives, and normatively neutral. A very interesting finding of this study is that this does not seem to differ particularly between drivers and non-drivers.”\n\n\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website. \nCarlton Reid\n\n\n\n\n\n\tEditorial Standards\n\tPrint\n\tReprints & Permissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

No one knew why, though Tesla’s engineers had some good guesses: Stationary objects and flashing lights seemed to trick the A.I. The car would be driving along normally, the computer well in control, and suddenly it would veer to the right or left and — smash — at least 10 times in just over three years.\nFor a company that depended on an unbounded sense of optimism among investors to maintain its high stock price — Tesla was at one point worth more than Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW, Ford and General Motors combined — these crashes might seem like a problem. But to Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, they presented an opportunity. Each collision generated data, and with enough data, the company could speed the development of the world’s first truly self-driving car. He believed in this vision so strongly that it led him to make wild predictions: “My guess as to when we would think it is safe for somebody to essentially fall asleep and wake up at their destination: probably toward the end of next year,” Musk said in 2019. “I would say I am certain of that. That is not a question mark.”\nThe future of Tesla may rest on whether drivers knew that they were engaged in this data-gathering experiment, and if so, whether their appetite for risk matched Musk’s. I wanted to hear from the victims of some of the more minor accidents, but they tended to fall into two categories, neither of which predisposed them to talk: They either loved Tesla and Musk and didn’t want to say anything negative to the press, or they were suing the company and remaining silent on the advice of counsel. (Umair Ali, whose Tesla steered into a highway barrier in 2017, had a different excuse: “Put me down as declined interview because I don’t want to piss off the richest man in the world.”)\nThen I found Dave Key. On May 29, 2018, Key’s 2015 Tesla Model S was driving him home from the dentist in Autopilot mode. It was a route that Key had followed countless times before: a two-lane highway leading up into the hills above Laguna Beach, Calif. But on this trip, while Key was distracted, the car drifted out of its lane and slammed into the back of a parked police S.U.V., spinning the car around and pushing the S.U.V. up onto the sidewalk. No one was hurt.\n\n\n\nKey, a 69-year-old former software entrepreneur, took a dispassionate, engineer’s-eye view of his own accident. “The problem with stationary objects — I’m sorry, this sounds stupid — is that they don’t move,” he said. For years, Tesla’s artificial intelligence had trouble separating immobile objects from the background. Rather than feeling frustrated that the computer hadn’t figured out such a seemingly elementary problem, Key took comfort in learning that there was a reason behind the crash: a known software limitation, rather than some kind of black-swan event.\nLast fall, I asked Key to visit the scene of the accident with me. He said he would do me one better; he would take me there using Tesla’s new Full Self-Driving mode, which was still in beta. I told Key that I was surprised he was still driving a Tesla, much less paying extra — F.S.D. now costs $15,000 — for new autonomous features. If my car had tried to kill me, I would have switched brands. But in the months and years after his Model S was totaled, he bought three more.\nWe met for breakfast at a cafe in Laguna Beach, about three miles from the crash site. Key was wearing a black V-neck T-shirt, khaki shorts and sandals: Southern California semiretirement chic. As we walked to our table, he locked the doors of his red 2022 Model S, and the side mirrors folded up like a dog’s ears when it’s being petted.\nKey had brought along a four-page memo he drafted for our interview, listing facts about the accident, organized under subheadings like “Tesla Full Self-Driving Technology (Discussion).” He’s the sort of man who walks around with a battery of fully formed opinions on life’s most important subjects — computers, software, exercise, money — and a willingness to share them. He was particularly concerned that I understand that Autopilot and F.S.D. were saving lives: “The data shows that their accident rate while on Beta is far less than other cars,” one bullet point read, in 11-point Calibri. “Slowing down the F.S.D. Beta will result in more accidents and loss of life based on hard statistical data.”\n\n\n\nAccidents like his — and even the deadly ones — are unfortunate, he argued, but they couldn’t distract society from the larger goal of widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Key drew an analogy to the coronavirus vaccines, which prevented hundreds of thousands of deaths but also caused rare deaths and injuries from adverse reactions. “As a society,” he concluded, “we choose the path to save the most lives.”\n\n\n\nImage\nElon Musk has summed up his attitude toward risk as “most good for most number of people.”Credit...Jae C. Hong/Associated Press\n\n\nWe finished breakfast and walked to the car. Key had hoped to show off the newest version of F.S.D., but his system hadn’t updated yet. “Elon said it would be released at the end of the week,” he said. “Well, it’s Sunday.” Musk had been hinting for weeks that the update would be a drastic improvement over F.S.D. 10.13, which had been released over the summer. Because Musk liked to make little jokes out of the names and numbers in his life, the version number would jump to 10.69 with this release. (The four available Tesla models are S, 3, X and Y, presumably because that spells the word “sexy.”)\nKey didn’t want to talk about Musk, but the executive’s reputational collapse had become impossible to ignore. He was in the middle of his bizarre, on-again-off-again campaign to take over Twitter, to the dismay of Tesla loyalists. And though he hadn’t yet attacked Anthony Fauci or spread conspiracy theories about Nancy Pelosi’s husband or gone on a journalist-banning spree on the platform, the question was already suggesting itself: How do you explain Elon Musk?\n“People are flawed,” Key said cautiously, before repeating a sentiment that Musk often said about himself: If partisans on both sides hated him, he must be doing something right. No matter what trouble Musk got himself into, Key said, he was honest — “truthful to his detriment.”\nAs we drove, Key compared F.S.D. and the version of Autopilot on his 2015 Tesla. Autopilot, he said, was like fancy cruise control: speed, steering, crash avoidance. Though in his case, he said, “I guess it didn’t do crash avoidance.” He had been far more impressed by F.S.D. It was able to handle just about any situation he threw at it. “My only real complaint is it doesn’t always select the lane that I would.”\nAfter a minute, the car warned Key to keep his hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. “Tesla now is kind of a nanny about that,” he complained. If Autopilot was once dangerously permissive of inattentive drivers — allowing them to nod off behind the wheel, even — that flaw, like the stationary-object bug, had been fixed. “Between the steering wheel and the eye tracking, that’s just a solved problem,” Key said.\nSoon we were close to the scene of the crash. Scrub-covered hills with mountain-biking trails lacing through them rose on either side of us. That was what got Key into trouble on the day of the accident. He was looking at a favorite trail and ignoring the road. “I looked up to the left, and the car went off to the right,” he said. “I was in this false sense of security.”\n\n\n\nWe parked at the spot where he hit the police S.U.V. four years earlier. There was nothing special about the road here: no strange lines, no confusing lane shift, no merge. Just a single lane of traffic running along a row of parked cars. Why the Tesla failed at that moment was a mystery.\nEventually, Key told F.S.D. to take us back to the cafe. As we started our left turn, though, the steering wheel spasmed and the brake pedal juddered. Key muttered a nervous, “OK. … ”\nAfter another moment, the car pulled halfway across the road and stopped. A line of cars was bearing down on our broadside. Key hesitated a second but then quickly took over and completed the turn. “It probably could have then accelerated, but I wasn’t willing to cut it that close,” he said. If he was wrong, of course, there was a good chance that he would have had his second A.I.-caused accident on the same one-mile stretch of road.\nThree weeks before Key hit the police S.U.V., Musk wrote an email to Jim Riley, whose son Barrett died after his Tesla crashed while speeding. Musk sent Riley his condolences, and the grieving father wrote back to ask whether Tesla’s software could be updated to allow an owner to set a maximum speed for the car, along with other restrictions on acceleration, access to the radio and the trunk and distance the car could drive from home. Musk, while sympathetic, replied: “If there are a large number of settings, it will be too complex for most people to use. I want to make sure that we get this right. Most good for most number of people.”\nIt was a stark demonstration of what makes Musk so unusual as a chief executive. First, he reached out directly to someone who was harmed by one of his products — something it’s hard to imagine the head of G.M. or Ford contemplating, if only for legal reasons. (Indeed, this email was entered into evidence after Riley sued Tesla.) And then Musk rebuffed Riley. No vague “I’ll look into it” or “We’ll see what we can do.” Riley receives a hard no.\nLike Key, I want to resist Musk’s tendency to make every story about him. Tesla is a big car company with thousands of employees. It existed before Elon Musk. It might exist after Elon Musk. But if you want a parsimonious explanation for the challenges the company faces — in the form of the lawsuits, a crashing stock price and an A.I. that still seems all too capable of catastrophic failure — you should look to its mercurial, brilliant, sophomoric chief executive.\nPerhaps there’s no mystery here: Musk is simply a narcissist, and every reckless swerve he makes is meant solely to draw the world’s attention. He seemed to endorse this theory in a tongue-in-cheek way during a recent deposition, when a lawyer asked him, “Do you have some kind of unique ability to identify narcissistic sociopaths?” and he replied, “You mean by looking in the mirror?”\n\n\n\nBut what looks like self-obsession and poor impulse control might instead be the fruits of a coherent philosophy, one that Musk has detailed on many occasions. It’s there in the email to Riley: the greatest good for the greatest number of people. That dictum, as part of an ad hoc system of utilitarian ethics, can explain all sorts of mystifying decisions that Musk has made, not least his breakneck pursuit of A.I., which in the long term, he believes, will save countless lives.\nUnfortunately for Musk, the short term comes first, and his company faces a rough few months. In February, the first lawsuit against Tesla for a crash involving Autopilot will go to trial. Four more will follow in quick succession. Donald Slavik, who will represent plaintiffs in as many as three of those cases, says that a normal car company would have settled by now: “They look at it as a cost of doing business.” Musk has vowed to fight it out in court, no matter the dangers this might present for Tesla. “The dollars can add up,” Slavik said, “especially if there’s any finding of punitive damages.”\nThe many claims of the pending lawsuits come back to a single theme: Tesla consistently inflated consumer expectations and played down the dangers involved.\n\nSlavik sent me one of the complaints he filed against Tesla, which lists prominent Autopilot crashes from A to Z — in fact, from A to WW. In China, a Tesla slammed into the back of a street sweeper. In Florida, a Tesla hit a tractor-trailer that was stretched across two lanes of a highway. During a downpour in Indiana, a Tesla Model 3 hydroplaned off the road and burst into flames. In the Florida Keys, a Model S drove through an intersection and killed a pedestrian. In New York, a Model Y struck a man who was changing his tire on the shoulder of the Long Island Expressway. In Montana, a Tesla steered unexpectedly into a highway barrier. Then the same thing happened in Dallas and in Mountain View and in San Jose.\nThe arrival of self-driving vehicles wasn’t meant to be like this. Day in, day out, we scare and maim and kill ourselves in cars. In the United States last year, there were around 11 million road accidents, nearly five million injuries and more than 40,000 deaths. Tesla’s A.I. was meant to put an end to this blood bath. Instead, on average, there is at least one Autopilot-related crash in the United States every day, and Tesla is under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nEver since Autopilot was released in October 2015, Musk has encouraged drivers to think of it as more advanced than it was, stating in January 2016 that it was “probably better” than a human driver. That November, the company released a video of a Tesla navigating the roads of the Bay Area with the disclaimer: “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.” Musk also rejected the name “Copilot” in favor of “Autopilot.”\nThe fine print made clear that the technology was for driver assistance only, but that message received a fraction of the attention of Musk’s announcements. A large number of drivers seemed genuinely confused about Autopilot’s capabilities. (Tesla also declined to disclose that the car in the 2016 video crashed in the company’s parking lot.) Slavik’s legal complaint doesn’t hold back: “Tesla’s conduct was despicable, and so contemptible that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.”\n\n\n\nThe many claims of the pending lawsuits come back to a single theme: Tesla consistently inflated consumer expectations and played down the dangers involved. The cars didn’t have sufficient driver monitoring because Musk didn’t want drivers to think that the car needed human supervision. (Musk in April 2019: “If you have a system that’s at or below human-level reliability, then driver monitoring makes sense. But if your system is dramatically better, more reliable than a human, then monitoring does not help much.”) Drivers weren’t warned about problems with automatic braking or “uncommanded lane changes.” The company would admit to the technology’s limitations in the user manual but publish viral videos of a Tesla driving a complicated route with no human intervention.\nMusk’s ideal customer was someone like Key — willing to accept the blame when something went wrong but possessing almost limitless faith in the next update. In a deposition, an engineer at Tesla made this all but explicit: “We want to let the customer know that, No. 1, you should have confidence in your vehicle: Everything is working just as it should. And, secondly, the reason for your accident or reason for your incident always falls back on you.”\nAfter our failed left turn in Laguna Beach, Key quickly diagnosed the problem. If only the system had upgraded to F.S.D. 10.69, he argued, the car surely would have managed the turn safely. Unfortunately for Musk, not every Tesla owner is like Dave Key. The plaintiffs in the Autopilot lawsuits might agree that the A.I. is improving, but only on the backs of the early adopters and bystanders who might be killed along the way.\nOnline, there’s a battle between pro-Musk and anti-Musk factions about Autopilot and F.S.D. Reddit has a forum called r/RealTesla that showcases the most embarrassing A.I. screw-ups, along with more generic complaints: squeaky steering wheels, leaky roofs, haywire electronics, noisy cabins, stiff suspensions, wrinkled leather seats, broken door handles. The Musk stans tend to sequester themselves in r/TeslaMotors, where they post Tesla sightings, cheer on the company’s latest factory openings and await the next big announcement from the boss.\nI found David Alford on YouTube, where he posted a video called “Tesla Full Self-Driving Running a Red Light.” In it, we see the view through the windshield as Alford’s car approaches an intersection with a left-turn lane that has a dedicated traffic signal. With a few hundred yards remaining, the light shifts from green to red, but the car doesn’t stop. Instead, it rolls into the intersection, where it’s on track to collide with oncoming traffic, until Alford takes over.\nIn the comments, Tesla fans grow angry with Alford for posting the video, but he pushes back: “How does it help put pressure on Tesla to improve their systems if you are scared to post their faults?” Replying to one comment, he writes that F.S.D. is “unethical in the context they are using it.”\nWhen I called Alford, I was expecting someone suited for r/RealTesla, but he ended up having more of an r/TeslaMotors vibe. He told me that he would be willing to take me to the site of his video and demonstrate the failure, but first I had to make a promise. “The only thing I ask is try not to put me in a bad light toward Tesla,” he said. “I don’t want anybody to think that I hate the company or whatnot, because I’m a very, very big supporter of them.”\n\n\n\nAlford lives in Fresno, Calif., and before I went to meet him one day last fall, he told me some exciting news: He had just received the F.S.D. 10.69 update. Our drive would be his first attempt to navigate the intersection from the YouTube video with the new system.\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nCredit...Photo illustration by Justin Metz\n\n\nThe morning I met him, he was wearing a black T-shirt that showed off his tattoos, black sunglasses and faded black jeans with holes in the knees. Hollywood would typecast him as a white-hat hacker, and indeed he’s a software guy like Key: He is a product engineer for a Bay Area tech company.\nHis white 2020 Tesla Model 3 had a magnetic bumper sticker he found on Etsy: CAUTION FULL SELF-DRIVING TESTING IN PROGRESS. He said he drives in F.S.D. mode 90 percent of the time, so his car is always acting a bit strange — the sticker helped keep some of the honking from other cars at bay. He seemed to be, like Key, an ideal F.S.D. beta tester: interested in the software, alert to its flaws, dogged in his accumulation of autonomous miles.\n\nI climbed into the passenger seat, and Alford punched in our first destination: a spot a few blocks away in downtown Fresno. We were lucky it was overcast, he said, because the car behaved well in these conditions. On days when it was sunny out and there was a lot of glare, the car could be “moody.” And when it was foggy, and it was often foggy in Fresno, “it freaks out.”\nAfter a few minutes, we approached a crosswalk just as two parents pulling a child in a wagon began to cross. A screen next to the steering wheel showed that the A.I. had registered the two pedestrians but not the wagon. Alford said he was hovering his foot over the brake, but the car stopped on its own.\nAfter the wagon came a woman in a wheelchair. The car stayed put. Alford told me that the automotive jargon for anyone on the street who is not in a car or a truck is a “V.R.U.,” a vulnerable road user. And it’s true: Pedestrians and cyclists and children in strollers and women in wheelchairs — they are so fragile compared with these giant machines we’ve stuffed into our cities and onto our highways. One wrong move, and a car will crush them.\n\n\n\nWe turned on to Van Ness Avenue, which cuts through downtown. It had been newly paved, and instead of lines on the street, there were little yellow tabs indicating where the lines would eventually go. The Tesla hated this and dodged worriedly right and left, looking for something to anchor it. There were no other cars around, so Alford let it get that out of its system and eventually find a lane line to follow.\n“You build a tolerance to the risks it takes,” he said. “Yes, it’s swerving all over the place, but I know it’s not going to crash into something.” Still, the experience of the beta had changed the way he approached his own work. “It’s actually made me, as a software developer, more hesitant to put my software in the hands of people” before it’s fully ready, he said, “even though it’s not dangerous.”\nSeconds later, we drove through an intersection as two V.R.U.s — a man walking a dog — entered the crosswalk. They were a safe distance away, but the dog started to strain against its leash in our direction. Alford and I knew that the pet wasn’t in peril because the leash would stop it. But all the Tesla saw was a dog about to jump in front of us, and it came to an abrupt stop. It was a good outcome, all things considered — no injuries to any life-form — but it was far from a seamless self-driving experience.\nAlford nudged the steering wheel just often enough that the car never warned him to pay attention. He didn’t mind the strict driver monitoring: He never tired of studying the car’s behavior, so he was never tempted to tune out. Still, he knew people who abused the system. One driver tied an ankle weight to the steering wheel to “kick back and do whatever” during long road trips. “I know a couple of people with Teslas that have F.S.D. beta,” he said, “and they have it to drink and drive instead of having to call an Uber.”\nWe left downtown and got on the highway, headed toward an area northeast of the city called Clovis, where the tricky intersection was. Alford pulled up his F.S.D. settings. His default driver mode was Average, but he said he has found that the two other options — Chill and Assertive — aren’t much different: “The car is just really aggressive anyway.” For highway driving, though, he had the car set to something called Mad Max mode, which meant it would overtake any vehicle in front of him if it was going even a few miles per hour slower than his preferred speed.\nWe exited the highway and quickly came to a knot of cars. Something had gone wrong with the traffic light, which was flashing red, and drivers in all four directions, across eight lanes, had to figure out when to go and when to yield. The choreography here was delicate: There were too many cars to interweave without some allowances being made for mercy and confusion and expediency. Among the humans, there was a good deal of waving others on and attempted eye contact to see whether someone was going to yield or not.\nWe crept toward the intersection, car by car, until it was our turn. If we were expecting nuance, there was none. Once we had come to a complete stop, the Tesla accelerated quickly, cutting off one car turning across us and veering around another. It was not so much inhuman as the behavior of a human who was determined to be a jerk. “That was bad,” Alford said. “Normally I would disengage once it makes a mistake like that.” He clicked a button to send a snapshot of the incident to Tesla.\n\n\n\nLater, at a four-way stop, the car was too cautious. It waited too long, and the other two cars at the intersection drove off before we did. We talked about the old saying about safe driving: “Don’t be nice; be predictable.” For a computer, Tesla’s A.I. was surprisingly erratic. “It’s not nice or predictable,” Alford said.\nA few miles down the road, we reached the intersection from the video: a left turn onto East Shepherd Avenue from State Route 168. The traffic light sits right at the point where the city’s newest developments end and open land begins. If we drove straight, we would immediately find ourselves surrounded by sagebrush, on the way up into the Sierra.\nTo replicate the error that Alford uncovered, we needed to approach the intersection with a red left-turn arrow and a green light to continue straight. On our first pass, the arrow turned green at the last second. On the second pass, though, on an empty road, the timing was right: a red for our turn and green for everyone else.\nAs we got closer, the car moved into the turning lane and started to slow. “It sees the red,” I said.\n“No,” Alford said. “It always slows down a little here before plowing through.” But this time, it kept slowing. Alford couldn’t believe it. “It’s still going to run the light,” he said. But he was wrong: We came to a tidy stop right at the line. Alford was shocked. “They fixed it!” he said. “That one I’ve been giving them an issue about for two years.” We waited patiently until the light turned green, and the Tesla drove smoothly onto Shepherd Avenue. No problem.\nIt was as clear a demonstration of Musk’s hypothesis as one could hope for. There was a situation that kept stumping the A.I. until, after enough data had been collected by dedicated drivers like Alford, the neural net figured it out. Repeat this risk-reward conversion X number of times, and maybe Tesla will solve self-driving. Maybe even next year.\nOn the drive back to the center of Fresno, Alford was buoyant, delighted with the possibility that he had changed the Tesla world for the better. I asked him whether the F.S.D. 10.69 release met the hype that preceded it. “To be honest, yeah, I think so,” he said. (He was even more enthusiastic about the version of F.S.D. released in December, which he described as nearly flawless.)\n\n\n\nA few minutes later, we reached a rundown part of town. Alford said that in general Tesla’s A.I. does better in higher-income areas, maybe because those areas have more Tesla owners in them. “Are there data biases for higher-income areas because that’s where the Teslas are?” he wondered.\nWe approached an intersection and tried to make a left — in what turned out to be a repeat of the Laguna Beach scenario. The Tesla started creeping out, trying to get a clearer look at the cars coming from our left. It inched forward, inched forward, until once again we were fully in the lane of traffic. There was nothing stopping the Tesla from accelerating and completing the turn, but instead it just sat there. At the same time, a tricked-out Honda Accord sped toward us, about three seconds away from hitting the driver-side door. Alford quickly took over and punched the accelerator, and we escaped safely. This time, he didn’t say anything.\nIt was a rough ride home from there. At a standard left turn at a traffic light, the system freaked out and tried to go right. Alford had to take over. And then, as we approached a cloverleaf on-ramp to the highway, the car started to accelerate. To stay on the ramp, we needed to make an arcing right turn; in front of us was a steep drop-off into a construction site with no guard rails. The car showed no sign of turning. We crossed a solid white line, milliseconds away from jumping off the road when, at last, the wheel jerked sharply to the right, and we hugged the road again. This time, F.S.D. had corrected itself, but if it hadn’t, the crash would have surely killed us.\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nCredit...Photo illustration by Justin Metz\n\n\nPeter Thiel, Musk’s former business partner at PayPal, once said that if he wrote a book, the chapter about Musk would be called “The Man Who Knew Nothing About Risk.” But that’s a misunderstanding of Musk’s attitude: If you parse his statements, he presents himself as a man who simply embraces astonishing amounts of present-day risk in the rational assumption of future gains.\nMusk’s clearest articulation of his philosophy has come, of course, on Twitter. “We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!” he wrote to one user who asked him how to save the planet. In August, he called the writings of William MacAskill, a Scottish utilitarian ethicist, “a close match for my philosophy.” (MacAskill, notably, was also the intellectual muse of Sam Bankman-Fried, though he cut ties with him after the FTX scandal came to light.)\nMusk’s embrace of risk has produced true breakthroughs: SpaceX can land reusable rockets on remote-controlled landing pads in the ocean; Starlink is providing internet service to Ukrainians on the front lines; OpenAI creeps ever closer to passing the Turing test. As for Tesla, even Musk’s harshest critics — and I talked to many of them while reporting this article — would pause, unbidden, to give him credit for creating the now-robust market in electric vehicles in the United States and around the world.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, as Robert Lowell wrote, “No rocket goes as far astray as man.” In recent months, as the outrages at Twitter and elsewhere began to multiply, Musk seemed determined to squander much of the good will he had built up over his career. I asked Slavik, the plaintiffs’ attorney, whether the recent shift in public sentiment against Musk made his job in the courtroom any easier. “I think at least there are more people who are skeptical of his judgment at this point than were before,” he said. “If I were on the other side, I’d be worried about it.”\nSome of Musk’s most questionable decisions, though, begin to make sense if seen as a result of a blunt utilitarian calculus. Last month, Reuters reported that Neuralink, Musk’s medical-device company, had caused the needless deaths of dozens of laboratory animals through rushed experiments. Internal messages from Musk made it clear that the urgency came from the top. “We are simply not moving fast enough,” he wrote. “It is driving me nuts!” The cost-benefit analysis must have seemed clear to him: Neuralink had the potential to cure paralysis, he believed, which would improve the lives of millions of future humans. The suffering of a smaller number of animals was worth it.\nThis form of crude long-term-ism, in which the sheer size of future generations gives them added ethical weight, even shows up in Musk’s statements about buying Twitter. He called Twitter a “digital town square” that was responsible for nothing less than preventing a new American civil war. “I didn’t do it to make more money,” he wrote. “I did it to try to help humanity, whom I love.”\nAutopilot and F.S.D. represent the culmination of this approach. “The overarching goal of Tesla engineering,” Musk wrote, “is maximize area under user happiness curve.” Unlike with Twitter or even Neuralink, people were dying as a result of his decisions — but no matter. In 2019, in a testy exchange of email with the activist investor and steadfast Tesla critic Aaron Greenspan, Musk bristled at the suggestion that Autopilot was anything other than lifesaving technology. “The data is unequivocal that Autopilot is safer than human driving by a significant margin,” he wrote. “It is unethical and false of you to claim otherwise. In doing so, you are endangering the public.”\nI wanted to ask Musk to elaborate on his philosophy of risk, but he didn’t reply to my interview requests. So instead I spoke with Peter Singer, a prominent utilitarian philosopher, to sort through some of the ethical issues involved. Was Musk right when he claimed that anything that delays the development and adoption of autonomous vehicles was inherently unethical?\n“I think he has a point,” Singer said, “if he is right about the facts.”\nMusk rarely talks about Autopilot or F.S.D. without mentioning how superior it is to a human driver. At a shareholders’ meeting in August, he said that Tesla was “solving a very important part of A.I., and one that can ultimately save millions of lives and prevent tens of millions of serious injuries by driving just an order of magnitude safer than people.” Musk does have data to back this up: Starting in 2018, Tesla has released quarterly safety reports to the public, which show a consistent advantage to using Autopilot. The most recent one, from late 2022, said that Teslas with Autopilot engaged were one-tenth as likely to crash as a regular car.\nThat is the argument that Tesla has to make to the public and to juries this spring. In the words of the company’s safety report: “While no car can prevent all accidents, we work every day to try to make them much less likely to occur.” Autopilot may cause a crash WW times, but without that technology, we’d be at OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\n\n\n\nSinger told me that even if Autopilot and human drivers were equally deadly, we should prefer the A.I., provided that the next software update, based on data from crash reports and near misses, would make the system even safer. “That’s a little bit like surgeons doing experimental surgery,” he said. “Probably the first few times they do the surgery, they’re going to lose patients, but the argument for that is they will save more patients in the long run.” It was important, however, Singer added, that the surgeons get the informed consent of the patients.\nDoes Tesla have the informed consent of its drivers? The answer might be different for different car owners — it would probably be different for Dave Key in 2018 than it is in 2022. But most customers are not aware of how flawed Autopilot is, said Philip Koopman, the author of “How Safe Is Safe Enough? Measuring and Predicting Autonomous Vehicle Safety.” The cars keep making “really crazy, crazy, surprising mistakes,” he said. “Tesla’s practice of using untrained civilians as test drivers for an immature technology is really egregious.”\nKoopman also objects to Musk’s supposed facts. One obvious problem with the data the company puts out in its quarterly safety report is that it directly compares Autopilot miles, which are mainly driven on limited-access highways, with all vehicle miles. “You’re using Autopilot on the safe miles,” Koopman said. “So of course it looks great. And then you’re comparing it to not-Autopilot on the hard miles.”\nIn the third quarter of 2022, Tesla claimed that there was one crash for every 6.26 million miles driven using Autopilot — indeed, almost 10 times better than the U.S. baseline of one crash for every 652,000 miles. Crashes, however, are far more likely on surface streets than on the highway: One study from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation showed that crashes were five times as common on local roads as on turnpikes. When comparing Autopilot numbers to highway numbers, Tesla’s advantage drops significantly.\nTesla’s safety claims look even shakier when you try to control for the age of the car and the age of the driver. Most Tesla owners are middle-aged or older, which eliminates one risky pool of drivers: teenagers. And simply having a new car decreases your chance of an accident significantly. It’s even possible that the number of Teslas in California — with its generally mild, dry weather — has skewed the numbers in its favor. An independent study that tried to correct for some of these biases suggested that Teslas crashed just as often when Autopilot was on as when it was off.\n“That’s always been a problem for utilitarians,” Singer told me. “Because it doesn’t have strict moral rules, people might think they can get away with doing the sums in ways that suit their purposes.”\nUtilitarian thinking has led individuals to perform acts of breathtaking virtue, but putting this ethical framework in the hands of an industrialist presents certain dangers. True utilitarianism requires a careful balancing of all harms and benefits, in the present and the future, with the patience to do this assessment and the patience to refrain from acting if the amount of suffering and death caused by pushing forward wasn’t clear. Musk is using utilitarianism in a more limited way, arguing that as long as he’s sure something will have a net benefit, he’s permitted to do it right now.\n\n\n\nIn the past two decades, Musk has somehow maneuvered himself into running multiple companies where he can plausibly claim to be working to preserve the future of humanity. SpaceX can’t just deliver satellites into low orbit; it’s also going to send us to Mars. Tesla can’t just build a solid electric car; it’s going to solve the problem of self-driving. Twitter can’t just be one more place where we gather to argue; it’s one of the props holding up civilization. With the stakes suitably raised, all sorts of questionable behavior begin to look — almost — reasonable.\n“True believers,” the novelist Jeanette Winterson wrote, “would rather see governments topple and history rewritten than scuff the cover of their faith.” Musk seems unshakable in his conviction that his approach is right. But for all his urgency, he still might lose the A.I. race.\nRight now in San Francisco and Austin, Texas, and coming soon to cities all over the world, you can hail a robotaxi operated by Cruise or Waymo. “If there’s one moment in time where we go from fiction to reality, it’s now,” Sebastian Thrun, who founded Google’s self-driving car team, told me. (“I didn’t say this last year, by the way,” he added.) Thrun was no r/RealTesla lurker; he was on his fifth Tesla, and he said he admired the company: “What Tesla has is really beautiful. They have a fleet of vehicles in the field.” But at this point, Tesla’s competitors are closer to achieving full self-driving than any vehicle equipped with F.S.D.\nIn recent months, Musk has stopped promising that autonomous Teslas are just around the corner. “I thought the self-driving problem would be hard,” he said, “but it was harder than I thought. It’s not like I thought it’d be easy. I thought it would be very hard. But it was actually way harder than even that.”\nOn Dec. 29, 2019, the same day a Tesla in Indiana got into a deadly crash with a parked fire truck, an off-duty chauffeur named Kevin George Aziz Riad was driving his gray 2016 Tesla Model S down the Gardena Freeway in suburban Los Angeles. It had been a long drive back from a visit to Orange County, and Riad had Autopilot turned on. Shortly after midnight, the car passed under a giant sign that said END FREEWAY SIGNAL AHEAD in flashing yellow lights.\nThe Autopilot kept Riad’s Tesla at a steady speed as it approached the stoplight that marked the end of the freeway and the beginning of Artesia Boulevard. According to a witness, the light was red, but the car drove straight through the intersection, striking a Honda Civic. Riad had only minor injuries, but the two people in the Civic, Gilberto Alcazar Lopez and Maria Guadalupe Nieves, died at the scene. Their families said that they were on a first date.\nWho was responsible for this accident? State officials have charged Riad with manslaughter and plan to prosecute him as if he were the sole actor behind the two deaths. The victims’ families, meanwhile, have filed civil suits against both Riad and Tesla. Depending on the outcomes of the criminal and civil cases, the Autopilot system could be judged, in effect, legally responsible, not legally responsible or both simultaneously.\n\n\n\nNot long ago, I went to see the spot where Riad’s Tesla reportedly ran the red light. I had rented a Tesla for the day, to find out firsthand, finally, what it felt like to drive with Autopilot in control. I drove east on surface streets until I reached a ramp where I could merge onto State Route 91, the Gardena Freeway. It was late at night when Riad crashed. I was taking my ride in the middle of the day.\nAs soon as I was on the highway, I engaged Autopilot, and the car took over. I had the road mostly to myself. This Tesla was programmed to go 15 percent above the speed limit whenever Autopilot was in use, and the car accelerated quickly to 74 miles per hour, which was Riad’s speed when he crashed. Were his Autopilot speed settings the same?\nThe car did a good job of staying in its lane, better than any other traffic-aware cruise control I’ve used. I tried taking my hands off the wheel, but the Tesla beeped at me after a few seconds.\nAs I got closer to the crash site, I passed under the giant END FREEWAY SIGNAL AHEAD sign. The Autopilot drove on blithely. After another 500 feet, the same sign appeared again, flashing urgently. There was only a few hundred feet of divided highway left, and then Route 91 turned into a surface street, right at the intersection with Vermont Avenue.\nI hovered my foot over the brake. What was I doing? Seeing if the car truly would just blaze through a red light? Of course it would. I suppose I was trying to imagine how easy it would be to do such a thing. At the end of a long night, on a road empty of cars, with something called Autopilot in control? My guess is that Riad didn’t even notice that he had left the highway.\nThe car sped under the warning lights, 74 miles an hour. The crash data shows that before the Tesla hit Lopez and Nieves, the brakes hadn’t been used for six minutes.\nMy Tesla bore down on the intersection. I got closer and closer to the light. No brakes. And then, just before I was about to take over, a pickup truck swung out of the far right lane and cut me off. The Tesla sensed it immediately and braked hard. If only that truck — as undeniable as any giant chunk of hardware can be — had been there in December 2019, Lopez and Nieves would still be alive.\n\nSource photographs: Alamy; Shutterstock.\nChristopher Cox is an editor at New York magazine and the author of “The Deadline Effect.” His last article for The Times Magazine was about the business empire of the restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten.

Super-resolution electron microscopy combined with deep machine learning enabled the UCI-led team to decipher minute changes at the interface of materials sandwiched together in lithium-ion batteries.\n\n“We are particularly interested in nickel, as it can help us transition away from cobalt as a cathode material,” said co-author Huolin Xin, UCI professor of physics and astronomy. “Cobalt is toxic, so it’s dangerous to mine and handle, and it’s often extracted under socially repressive conditions in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo.”\n\nBut for the change to be fully realized, battery developers need to know what goes on inside the cells as they are repeatedly discharged and recharged. The high energy density of nickel-layered lithium-ion batteries has been found to cause rapid chemical and mechanical breakdown of LIBs’ component materials.\n\nThe team used a transmission electron microscope and atomistic simulations to learn how oxidation phase transitions impact battery materials, causing imperfections in an otherwise fairly uniform surface.\n\n“This project, which relied heavily on some of the world’s most powerful microscopy technologies and advanced data science approaches, clears the way for the optimization of high-nickel-content lithium-ion batteries,” Xin said. “Knowing how these batteries operate at the atomic scale will help engineers develop LIBs with vastly improved power and life cycles.”\n\nFunded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the project relied on facilities at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, and the UC Irvine Materials Research Institute. Paper co-authors included Chunyang Wang, UCI postdoctoral scholar in physics and astronomy; Tianjiao Lei, UCI postdoctoral scholar in materials science and engineering; and Kim Kisslinger and Xuelong Wang of Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tUniversity of California Irvine\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t 0\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFacebookTwitterGoogle+ReddItWhatsAppPinterestEmail\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiednewsdesk\n\n\t\t\t\t\t45951 posts\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t0 comments\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Prev Post\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tUniversity of California Irvine researchers find how human brains turn into smarter disease fighters\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNext Post \n\n\t\t\t\tUniversity of California Irvine’s online criminology master’s program ranked number 1\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tYou might also like\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMore from author\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInternational News\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArizona International hosts Dr. TV Nagendra Prasad, Consul General of India to the…\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAustralia Education\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDarshan Shelat, a student pursuing Masters in IT and Systems at the University of…\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInternational News\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tADB Issues First Gender Bond in Georgia’s Domestic Capital Market\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInternational News\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSustainable Trade and Investment Key to Asia and Pacific’s Green Future\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prev\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNext \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tLeave A Reply\n Cancel Reply\nYour email address will not be published.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t© 2023 - India Education | Latest Education News  | Global Educational News | Recent Educational News.

David Helwig/SooToday    \n        \n            \n            \n                Listen to this article\n                00:04:27\n\n            \n\n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        A judge found Tim Coderre guilty of dangerous driving Tuesday for his actions involving two city police officers in a Beer Store parking lot nearly two years ago.\n\n\nOntario Court Justice Dana Peterson concluded the 61-year-old self-represented accused was driving aggressively, and his actions on June 29, 2021 were deliberate.\n\n\n\"He was obviously angry, and his anger overcame good judgment.\" \n\n\nThe crux of the case is whether his driving was a marked departure from what a reasonably prudent driver would do, the judge said.\n\n\nShe pointed to the circumstances surrounding his driving: it occurred in a parking lot, with people lined up outside the store at a busy time of the day.\n\n\nCoderre's decision to drive quickly was an intentional action. He put his foot on the gas and veered to the left.\n\n\nThis is a marked departure from the norm and it required both Coderre and one of the officers to take evasive actions, she said.\n\n\nCoderre, who had a medical exemption from wearing a mask, had been Involved in a heated exchange with a store employee.\n\n\nPeterson noted he had admitted he was angry and frustrated and clearly felt his actions were justified.\n\n\nThis doesn't answer why he felt entitled to unleash his anger on staff and the police officers, she said.\n\n\nDuring a two-day trial in January, court heard that officers were called to the Bruce Street store about a \"highly agitated\" customer who was refusing to wear a mask.\n\n\nAfter speaking with Coderre, they indicated he could leave the parking lot. He put his van in reverse and revved it at a high rate of speed, placing it between their police vehicles.\n\n\nHe then shifted into gear and again accelerated, nearly hitting a cruiser and forcing one of the officers to \"jump back.\"\n\n\nWhen Coderre took the stand in his own defence, he maintained the officers had put themselves in harm's way.\n\n\nHe denied he was driving at a high rate of speed and accused the officers of targeting him.\n\n\n\"I did what I did for safety reasons and nobody got hurt.\"\n\n\nOn Tuesday, after hearing sentencing submissions from the Crown and accused, Peterson granted Coderre a conditional discharge, placing him on probation for 12 months.\n\n\nA judge can only grant a discharge if it's in the interest of the accused and not contrary to the public interest.\n\n\nIf Coderre complies with the conditions there will be no conviction registered against him and he won't have a criminal record.\n\n\nDuring his probation, he must make a $500 donation to the Sault Area Hospital, complete 40 hours of community service and take any recommended counselling.\n\n\nA driving prohibition is discretionary and not mandatory for this offence, Peterson said, noting his actions occurred for a few seconds.\n\n\nShe opted not to impose the restriction because Coderre is a caregiver for his wife and brother-in-law.\n\n\nProsecutor Blair Hagan had argued that the offence called for a custodial sentence.\n\n\nNoting Coderre's family commitments, she indicated she wasn't seeking real jail, but \"jail to be served in the community — six months house arrest.\"\n\n\nHagan also called for a two-year driving prohibition, suggesting he should be punished for his conduct.\n\n\n\"His driving conduct was inappropriate,\" she said. \"He should lose his driving privileges for that conduct.\"\n\n\nThe assistant Crown attorney cited the need for general and specific deterrence.\n\n\n\"It suggests we take these offences seriously\" and tells Coderre his conduct is not acceptable.\n\n\nThis \"essentially boils down to mere seconds of driving\" at a high rate of speed and making a dangerous manoeuver, Hagan said. \"He let his anger get the best of him.\"\n\n\nWhen Coderre made his submission, he spent nearly 40 minutes re-arguing his case.\n\n\nHe painted himself as a victim, harassed by police because of his involvement in earlier anti-mask events at Bellevue Park, where all they were doing was \"eating hamburgers and hot dogs\" and singing the National Anthem.\n\n\n\"I lead an exemplary life and I get pulled over.\"\n\n\nThe officers conspired against him, he said, accusing them of stealing his phone and deleting evidence from it.\n\n\nOften speaking of himself in the third person, and raising his voice, he said \"they were

latitude about why you feel victimized and persecuted.\"\n\n\nShe asked him to tell the court his sentencing position.\n\n\nReferring to his \"unblemished record,\"  Coderre said he's \"gone through

In Glendale, a neighbor’s cell phone video caught the moments the batteries exploded in someone else’s garage. “These batteries are dangerous,” said Phoenix Fire Department Captain Todd Keller. “It’s so important to follow the manufacturers instructions. If it looks deformed, gives off an odor or changes color, it’s time to replace that battery. And when that battery needs to be replaced, take it to a battery recycling facility.”\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n\n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReplay Video\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSETTINGS\n\nOFF\n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n\n\n\nHD\n\nHQ\n\nSD\n\nLO\n\n                \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSkip Ad\n\n\n                \n            \n        \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n\n            \n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n    \n\n\n\nDelano has a message for anyone who might have batteries lying around. “It was shocking to see how quickly it happened and how easily it happened too,” she said. “If you have lithium-ion batteries in your home, be aware of it.”\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGo to MSN Home\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n     \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n \n \n\n Microsoft Store Offers - Sponsored\n \n\n\n\t\n \n \n The Highest Paying Cash Back Card Is Finally Here\n\n \n NextAdvisor\n\n \n\n\n\t\n \n \n This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n \n The Motley Fool\n\n \n\n\n\t\n \n \n Savvy Americans are moving their money to these banks\n\n \n MSN Money\n\n \n\n\n\t\n \n \n These are the best mortgage rates in your area\n\n \n MSN Money\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n \n \n \n\n More from Arizona's Family\n \n\n\n \n\t\n\n \n\n  Commemorative artist’s 22nd Super Bowl creating fantastic works\n \n \n Arizona's Family\n\n\n\n                        \n\n                    \n                \n\t\n\n \n\n  First Lady Jill Biden visiting Mesa Community College during Arizona stop next week\n \n \n Arizona's Family\n\n\n\n                        \n\n                    \n                \n\t\n\n \n\n  PGA Tour releases exclusive game as golf gains popularity in virtual reality\n \n \n Arizona's Family\n\n\n\n                        \n\n                    \n                \n\n\n         \n            \n                \n                   \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Arizona's Family\n                \n\n                \n                    \n                       Visit Site\n                    \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\nHome\n\n\t\nNews\n\n\t\nWeather\n\n\t\nEntertainment\n\n\t\nMoney\n\n\t\nSports\n\n\t\nEsports\n\n\t\nLifestyle\n\n\t\nShopping\n\n\t\nBuy a car\n\n\t\nHealth & Fitness\n\n\t\nFood & Drink\n\n\t\nTravel\n\n\t\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n © 2023 Microsoft\n Privacy & Cookies\n Terms of use\n About our Ads\n Feedback\n Help\n MSN Blog\n About Us\n Editorial Standards\n Your California Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n \n     \n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n \n",

Star-Advertiser\nHonolulu Fire Department warns of danger with lithium-ion batteries\n\nRead full article\n\n\nRosemarie Bernardo, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser\nDecember 16, 2022, 12:05 PM·3 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec. 16—As many shoppers purchase gift items such as cellphones, laptop computers and electric tools during the holiday season, the Honolulu Fire Department is warning the public about potential dangers tied to lithium-ion batteries found in those items.\nAs many shoppers purchase gift items such as cellphones, laptop computers and electric tools during the holiday season, the Honolulu Fire Department is warning the public about potential dangers tied to lithium-ion batteries found in those items.\n\nWhile lithium-ion batteries are safe to use, problems can occur if the batteries are defective, damaged or mishandled, such as by overcharging, Capt. Jonathan Darr of the Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Unit said at a news conference held this week at the Kakaako Fire Station. Such cases can touch off a chemical reaction called \"thermal runaway \" that occurs when a lithium-ion battery cell enters an uncontrollable self-heating state, Darr said.\nThermal runaway can cause the battery to reach extremely high temperatures and produce a lot of toxic, flammable gases that might appear as white smoke. \"This could result in intense fires, \" Darr said.\n\n\nHe advised, \"If a battery is overheating and you notice an odor or a change in shape or color or leaking or odd noises from the device, then it's possible the device is going into thermal runaway.\" At that time, Darr said, if possible, move that item away from anything that could catch fire and call 911.\nThe Fire Department recommends charging devices with lithium-ion batteries outside of the home or in well-ventilated areas.\nIn late November a blaze erupted at a two-story Monte Street home in Kalihi after an electric bike being charged in a bedroom caught fire. The bedroom was also used as a storage room.\nHonolulu firefighter Kamehalani Ortiz, who investigated the fire, said, the e-bike was surrounded by combustibles. \"Once that ignited, it started a chain reaction that was very difficult to stop.\"\nStory continues\nFive people who were in the home at the time safely escaped after smoke detectors alerted them to the blaze. The cause of the fire was determined to be accidental due to thermal runaway of a lithium-ion battery in the e-bike. Damage to the home and its contents was estimated at more than $170, 000.\nIn a time frame of nearly three years—January 2020 to Dec. 12—the Fire Department responded to 386 building or structure fires. Of that figure, 167 were accidental fires, 58 of which were caused by lithium-ion batteries. The count of battery-caused fires jumped from 10 in 2020 to 23 in 2021, and 25 so far this year.\nExperts recommend e-bike owners not leave an e-bike unattended while it's charging. Also, follow the manufacturer's instructions for charging and storage, and do not charge an e-bike overnight.\n\"Just having an ounce of prevention is going to save everybody a pound of pain, \" Ortiz said at the news conference.\nLITHIUM-ION BATTERY SAFETY TIPS The Honolulu Fire Department offers the following lithium-ion battery safety tips :—When purchasing a device, make sure it has the Underwriters Laboratories mark, which shows the product has been safely tested.—Follow the manufacturer's instructions for charging and storage. Always use the cord and power adapter made specifically for the device.—Do not charge a device under a pillow, on a bed or near combustibles.—Keep batteries /devices at room temperature. Do not place in direct sunlight.—Store batteries away from anything flammable.—Do not toss loose lithium-ion batteries in the trash. HFD recommends contacting the Honolulu Department of Environmental Services' Refuse Division at 808-768-3201 for instruction on proper disposal.\nFor more information, visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRENDING\n\n\t 1.

Drunk driving is a crime, one that can quickly lead to fatal consequences. Each day, 32 people die in drunk driving crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It’s so bad that Congress passed a requirement in last year’s mega Infrastructure spending bill that new cars won’t be able to start if they detect alcohol on the driver’s breath. \n\nTesla’s so-called Full Self-Driving Beta is nowhere near ready to shuttle its drunk owners home all on its lonesome. It’s barely able to turn left or drive in the snow and some Beta testers are frightened by the latest update’s flaws. FSD Beta was reportedly responsible for an 8-car pile up on San Francisco’s Bay Bridge just in time for the holidays, if fact. Tesla’s suite of software is currently under investigation by the NHTSA initially over hundreds of reports of phantom braking, but that was only the beginning. It’s now also investigating Autopilot (finally) after several cars crashed into stopped emergency vehicles. NHTSA is also looking into an Autopilot crash involving a motorcyclist. \nG/O Media may get a commission\n\n\nCurrently Discounted\nCarpuride 2023 Newest Wireless Apple Carplay & Android Auto\n\n\nMany any car work for you.\nMake calls, queue up Spotify, ask Siri to do stuff—it’s legit just CarPlay for cars that don't have CarPlay.\nBuy for $250 at AmazonUse the promo code Clip $30 Off Coupon\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it’s not just NHTSA! The U.S. Department of Justice is looking into Autopilot as a criminal matter. The State of California, which recently banned  “deceptively naming or marketing” vehicles as containing autonomous technology. Germany is investigating if Full Self-Driving and Autopilot is a danger to German drivers. Even Tesla admits you shouldn’t let FSD Beta drive for you. From the company’s website:\nThe currently enabled Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous. Full autonomy will be dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. ﻿\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Musk has promised actual autonomy is coming soon every year for the last nine years. It’s a promise to consumers Musk’s own lawyers called “merely aspirational” in court. And now competition like GM’s Super Cruise and Ford’s BlueCruise seem to be running laps around FSD Beta.\nThis is all a very long way of saying when you are intoxicated behind the wheel of your Tesla and let that $15,000 FSD Beta take the wheel for you, that is a crime. You are indeed driving drunk. The Beta is still stuck at Level 2 autonomy and you need to be aware and alert to take over at any time and you can’t do that wasted. \n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story luckily didn’t end in tragedy, but then again, we don’t hear from the fatalities of drunk drivers on Twitter Spaces. They’re lost forever. This problem and its solution, isn’t new, or difficult to understand: Just don’t drive drunk. Ever. No matter what hyped-up tech you have in your car. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n",

Over the past ten years, the market for Electric Vehicles (EVs) increased dramatically, partly due to aggressive sales goals set globally. Lithium-ion batteries must be carefully discarded at end-of-life to maximize reuse and recycling, which necessitates an effective and secure system for its collection and transportation.\n\nGet a PDF brochure for Industrial Insights and Business Intelligence @  \n\nHowever, some of the disadvantages of these batteries are they contain heavy metals such as mercury and lead which are among the dangerous substances. These batteries retain some of their charge, which raises the possibility of an accidental discharge that might endanger or harm persons as well as nearby property. Large lithium-based batteries, like those used in automotive applications, may be mislabeled as lead-acid batteries by regional battery manufacturers. Due to these problems, state or federal governments restrict the transportation and storage of used batteries.\n\nDevelopments such as manufacturing on a large scale, lower component prices, and adoption of technologies to boost battery capacity are factors leading to a decline in the prices of lithium-ion batteries. For instance, in the U.S., Battery Resources is planning to open a 154,000-square-foot recycling facility in August 2022, which is expected to be among the largest in the North American region. Moreover, it will have the capacity to recycle 30,000 metric tons of lithium-ion batteries per year. These factors are anticipated to improve the transportation battery recycling market share over the coming years.\n\nEnquiry Before Buying:  \n\nThe global transportation battery recycling market is segmented based on type, sources, and region.

It caused the car to accelerate, about 50 miles an hour or something.\n\n\n\"It’s a simple example, but it shows some of the harms we have to guard against,\" Wray said.\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"A different kind of harm we’re concerned about is the enormous amount of data that autonomous vehicles, for example, aggregate.

He said Russia’s war against Ukraine is giving U.S. national security officials new examples of how cyberattacks are evolving and demonstrated how early surveillance activity can be a precursor to a cyberattack.\nStory continues\n\"We did see as the conflict erupted an increased effort by the Russian intelligence services, which have been conducting malicious cyber activity against U.S. infrastructure for years,\" he said. \"We’re increasingly concerned that the surveillance activity – the scanning, the research, all the preparatory activity – could be one thing, could be an indication of something more serious.\"\nGOP LAWMAKER HAS A MESSAGE FOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY AND THE FBI: ‘ONE DAY WE’RE BRINGING YOU IN'\n\"The name of the game in terms of cyber defense from our perspective is to try to get – to use a terrorism analogy – further left of boom,\" Wray added.\nThe U.S. is also worried about China’s growing Artificial Intelligence program.\n\"The Chinese government has a bigger hacking program than any other nation in the world, and their AI program is not constrained by the rule of law,\" he said. \"It’s built on top of the massive troves of intellectual property and sensitive data that they’ve stolen over the years and will be used unless checked to advance that same hacking program.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"That’s something we’re deeply concerned about and I think everyone here should be deeply concerned about it,\" Wray said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Stories\n\n\t\nPopular Mechanics\nBREAKING: U.S. Military Shoots Down Another ‘High-Altitude Object’ Over Alaska\n\nThe U.S. military has downed another mysterious high-altitude object flying over Alaska airspace.

Dist. Atty. George Gascón. \nRadimak also faces charges in a January 2020 incident in which he allegedly attacked a driver in Hollywood. When his car was searched, steroids were found along with $30,000, according to Gascón. \nSunday's road-rage incident on the 2 near York Boulevard, was captured on a driver's dashboard camera, authorities said. The video shows a man stop his dark-colored Tesla in traffic, charge another car with a pipe and then strike the car multiple times.\nRadimak was arrested in Torrance, with the California Highway Patrol confirming two outstanding warrants totaling over $5.1 million in bail. \nHe was charged Tuesday with four counts of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury and criminal threats. He was also charged with one felony count of vandalism, two misdemeanor counts of vandalism and one misdemeanor count of elder abuse.\n“This reign of terror ends today,” Gascón said in a statement . “Motorists in Los Angeles shouldn’t have to live in fear of being attacked while simply driving on the freeway.\"\nGascon added that his office, along with law enforcement, would investigate to see if additional charges would be added.\nRadimak pleaded not guilty. He's expected back in court on Feb. 14.\nTips from the public led to his arrest, and his black 2022 Tesla Model X was seized by police, according to the CHP.\nPrior to the Jan. 11 incident , Radimak allegedly threatened two women in separate events on Nov. 9. The first occurrence involved a threat to attack a woman at an Atwater Village storage facility. Radimak later allegedly stopped his vehicle on a freeway and smashed a female driver's headlight while making more threats.\nRadimak is also accused of issuing threats to a 74-year-old woman in Glendale in June.\nIn the January 2020 when he allegedly attacked a driver in Hollywood, he was charged with one felony count for the sale of a controlled substance and one misdemeanor count of battery.\nGascon said Radimak was a flight risk and danger to the community and asked that he be detained. A judge agreed on Tuesday.\nThe case continues to be investigated by multiple law enforcement agencies.\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGo to MSN Home\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n     \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n \n \n \n\n More From LA Times\n \n\n\n \n\t\n\n \n\n  'How can I go on without a mother?'

The company's full self driving feature hit the news recently when it emerged that a driver who was allegedly using the feature caused a multi-car pile up on San Francisco's Bay Bridge. The accident involved eight vehicles and left nine people, including a young child, injured. The accident took place on the same day that CEO Elon Musk announced the full self-driving beta was available for people who both bought the option and opt to download it.\n\n \n \nResearch\n\n\n\nMake (e.g. Cadillac)\n\n\n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\nAs of October 2022, there had been over 270 crashes that allegedly involved a Tesla driver who was using the vehicle's autopilot feature. Five of those accidents resulted in at least one fatality (via NHTSA). \"Autopilot\" refers to the suite of autonomous features Teslas can come with. This includes navigation tools, which suggest the best route to a destination and can recommend things like lane changes, to \"auto steering,\" to a feature called \"smart summon\" which allows the car to drive itself to you in certain garages. While driver aids are helpful, the person in charge of the vehicle has to legally be in the driver's seat and ready to intervene if something is about to go wrong.\nDOJ Allegedly Requested Tesla Documents\nOn page 86 of the filing lodged with the SEC, the electric car maker states: \"the company has received requests from the Department of Justice (DOJ) for documents related to Tesla's Autopilot and FSD features. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred.\" This claim could be related to a rumor from last year, in which several sources claimed the DOJ was investigating a potential breach of federal law.\nAt the time, it was theorized that the case could relate to some of the claims Musk has made about the car's self-driving features. This includes a suggestion that the feature is better than a human driver, and that it could take you from location to location without you ever touching the wheel. Musk also released a staged video, which is embedded above, to show the feature's potential capabilities back in 2016. \nThere is a chance these claims could constitute some degree of fraud, or put Tesla drivers in danger by overstating what the car was capable of doing on its own. Although this is the first real indication some form of investigation has happened or is happening, the DOJ has still not commented on the matter. But if an investigation is active and does go anywhere, more details will eventually emerge.\nRead this next: The Transformation Of Tesla From 2003 To 2022\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGo to MSN Home\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n     \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\nHome\n\n\t\nNews\n\n\t\nWeather\n\n\t\nEntertainment\n\n\t\nMoney\n\n\t\nSports\n\n\t\nEsports\n\n\t\nLifestyle\n\n\t\nShopping\n\n\t\nBuy a car\n\n\t\nHealth & Fitness\n\n\t\nFood & Drink\n\n\t\nTravel\n\n\t\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n © 2023 Microsoft\n Privacy & Cookies\n Terms of use\n About our Ads\n Feedback\n Help\n MSN Blog\n About Us\n Editorial Standards\n Your California Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n \n     \n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n \n",

It caused the car to accelerate, about 50 miles an hour or something.\n\n\n\"It’s a simple example, but it shows some of the harms we have to guard against,\" Wray said.\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"A different kind of harm we’re concerned about is the enormous amount of data that autonomous vehicles, for example, aggregate.

He said Russia’s war against Ukraine is giving U.S. national security officials new examples of how cyberattacks are evolving and demonstrated how early surveillance activity can be a precursor to a cyberattack.\nStory continues\n\"We did see as the conflict erupted an increased effort by the Russian intelligence services, which have been conducting malicious cyber activity against U.S. infrastructure for years,\" he said. \"We’re increasingly concerned that the surveillance activity – the scanning, the research, all the preparatory activity – could be one thing, could be an indication of something more serious.\"\nGOP LAWMAKER HAS A MESSAGE FOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY AND THE FBI: ‘ONE DAY WE’RE BRINGING YOU IN'\n\"The name of the game in terms of cyber defense from our perspective is to try to get – to use a terrorism analogy – further left of boom,\" Wray added.\nThe U.S. is also worried about China’s growing Artificial Intelligence program.\n\"The Chinese government has a bigger hacking program than any other nation in the world, and their AI program is not constrained by the rule of law,\" he said. \"It’s built on top of the massive troves of intellectual property and sensitive data that they’ve stolen over the years and will be used unless checked to advance that same hacking program.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"That’s something we’re deeply concerned about and I think everyone here should be deeply concerned about it,\" Wray said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Stories\n\n\t\nUkrayinska Pravda\nRussian missiles fly into NATO country's air space\n\nTwo Russian Kalibr cruise missiles have crossed into Romanian air space during a large-scale missile attack on 10 February.

The basic Model Y now costs $52,990, a sharp decline from $65,990, Reuters found.\nThe price cuts add to the savings that U.S. customers will receive from a $7,500 federal tax credit that took hold for many electric vehicles at the outset of the year.\nCEO Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter in late October, has drawn scrutiny over his apparent focus on the social media platform.\nMORE: Tesla stock plummeted 12% in a single day.

Here's why.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, Musk has attributed the falling stock price to rising interest rates, which typically benefit savers who stand to gain from an uptick in the interest yielded by accounts held at banks.\nMusk has defended his actions at Twitter as part of an aggressive effort to rescue the company from financial peril, which he described in a Twitter Spaces interview last month as an \"emergency fire drill.\"\n\"That's the reason for my actions,\" he added. \"They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever.\"\n\n\n\n\nMusk said in December that he will resign as head of Twitter when the company identifies a successor.\nThe price cuts mark the second such announcement by Tesla. The company said in December that it would offer $7,500 discounts on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered in the U.S. that month.\nTesla remains the top seller of EVs in the U.S. but its lead has slipped in recent months as competitors offer a host of affordable alternatives, a S&P Global Mobility report showed in November.\nMORE: Who could Elon Musk choose as the next Twitter CEO?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company held a 65% market share of newly registered electric vehicles in the U.S. through the third quarter 2022, a drop from 71% in 2021 and 79% in 2020, the report found.\nIves, of Wedbush, said the price cut announced on Thursday could increase global sales this year by as much as 15%.\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a clear shot across the bow at European automakers and U.S. stalwarts (GM and Ford) that Tesla is not going to play nice in the sandbox with an EV price war now underway,\" he said.\nRelated Topics\nTeslaElon Musk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\nUS shoots down 'high-altitude object' over Alaska, White House says\n\n\t43 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese balloon reconnaissance platform located, officials say\n\n\t4 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\nFBI finds another classified document in search of Mike Pence's Indiana home\n\n\t1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\nMother left 2 young children home alone for nearly 2 months: Police\n\n\t1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\nAll-female Super Bowl flyover team to make history\n\n\tFeb 9, 10:45 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABC News Live\n\n\n\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABC News Network\nPrivacy Policy\nYour US State Privacy Rights\nChildren's Online Privacy Policy\nInterest-Based Ads\nAbout Nielsen Measurement\nTerms of Use\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nContact Us\nCopyright Â© 2023 ABC News Internet Ventures.

This kind of battery is used everywhere, from your smartwatch to your iPhone to electric vehicles. If you understand the way batteries work, it is possible to have your device’s battery working like new for years.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Source: Pexels\n\n\n\nTo prevent your iPhone’s battery from degrading over time, you must keep it from accumulating charge cycles. As those two conditions are the most harmful to a Lithium-ion battery, while keeping your battery level at 50% is best yet impractical The next sweet spot is between 20% and 80%.\n\n\n\n\nBreak the habit of keeping your phone constantly connected to a cable or a wireless charger. Additionally, aim to cut your iPhone’s battery usage as much as possible so that you don’t drag your iPhone into the “dangerous area” of 20% and below when you don’t have an available charger.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet Your iPhone Notify You When the Battery Is at 80%\n\n\n\n\nYou can easily let your iPhone notify you when it reaches a particular battery level,  such as 80% and 20%, by following the steps below.\n\n\n\n\n\tLaunch the “Shortcuts” app on your iPhone. If you don’t have it installed on your iPhone, download it from the App Store. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNavigate to the “Automation” section in the bottom bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTap on “Create a personal automation.” At this point, we are creating an automation that will launch a “then” condition: a notification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tA list with many different options will open. Tap on “Battery Level” to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tChoose the battery’s charge condition by dragging the white dot to the right until it reaches 80%, then select “Equals 80%” below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTap on “Add action.” You can also choose from the suggested actions below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tA prompt will appear, letting you choose from a vast catalog of available actions. You can let your iPhone play a music track by choosing “Play Music” or have your phone announce the notification via “Speak Text.” For this tutorial, we are choosing “Speak Text.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTell your phone what you want it to say. For instance, you can make it say, “Your battery is at 80% … Unplug me!” or unleash your imagination and create your own phrase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYou can tap the “Arrow” icon next to your text to customize it further, such as the speaking rate, pitch, and voice. If you leave the “Wait Until Finished” option enabled, your iPhone will continue speaking the rest of the text even after you unplug the cable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYou’ll be asked whether you want this automation to “Ask Before Running” and “Notify When Run.” In our case, leave both of them turned off, as we need the automation to run automatically without permission and already set up the spoken text notification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhen you navigate back to the “Automations” section in the “Shortcuts” app, you’ll see the new automation that you created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating Another Notification for Battery’s 20% Charge\n\n\n\n\nYou need to also set up the opposite automation that tells you when your phone is at a 20% charge so that you can connect it to the charger as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can do this by following the same steps aforementioned, but choose “Equals 20%” instead of “Equals 80.” By doing this, you will receive a notification once your iPhone is at a 20% charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing back to the “Automations” screen, you’ll see that you now have two automations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhat differentiates this method from the \"Optimized Battery Charging\" option?\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nApple has added an option called “Optimized Battery Charging” since iOS 13, which you can enable by navigating to “Settings -> Battery -> Battery Health & Charging.” However, this option allows your iPhone to pause charging when the phone reaches 80% and is still left on the charger. This usually applies when you charge your device overnight.\n\n\n\n\nApple relies on your usage patterns and the device’s alarm to predict when you’ll wake up, and before that, it continues charging to 100%. This prediction may not always be correct, and the device may continue charging after 80%. You’ll need to decide which option suits you the best.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nI've been using iPhones for years without battery issues. Is this workflow necessary for all iPhone owners? \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe practice of keeping the iPhone’s battery within a 20% to 80% charged state isn’t for everyone, but you’ll know that your device’s battery will stay in good shape for much longer when you keep it between 20% and 80%. Doing this may buy you an additional year of healthy battery life, and not doing it will lead to a weaker battery performance earlier.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tShould I set up an automation to run when the iPhone reaches 100%?\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nYes, you should. This will prevent the phone from being connected to the power after reaching 100%, and it will not help you exceed your battery’s health, as charging the iPhone battery up to 100% is harmful in the long term. You can set up this automation by following the aforementioned steps and choosing 100% instead of 80% or 20%.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDoes charging batteries to their full capacity hurt laptops, too?\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\nYes, and any Lithium-Ion battery in general. To avoid this manually, just remember to keep your device’s battery between 20% and 80%. Additionally, check to see whether your manufacturer provides a solution to prevent the battery from being fully charged. For instance, Lenovo laptops have a mode called “Conservation Mode.” When enabled, the device stays at 55% to 60% charge when connected to the charger. You can also monitor the battery’s health on Mac laptops.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Unsplash.

@WholeMarsBlog, joked on Thursday that they couldn't believe Musk had acquired Twitter.\n\"Me neither,\" the Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter CEO replied. \"Sucks that I had to sell so much Tesla stock to do so (sigh).\"\nMusk sold about $23 billion worth of Tesla stock last year, largely to finance his $44 billion Twitter purchase. The sales represent a significant chunk of his estimated $174 billion fortune as of Thursday's market close.\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\n                        \n                        \n\nTesla shares have rallied 74% to $188 this year, but still trade well below their peak price of over $400 in November 2021.\n—Elon Musk  (@elonmusk) February 3, 2023\nBattling Burry\nBurry has publicly bet against Tesla during the pandemic, and accused Musk in late 2021 of selling the automaker's stock because he knew it was hugely overvalued. The Scion Asset Management boss, who has predicted a stock-market crash and prolonged recession lie ahead, ominously tweeted \"sell\" and deleted his Twitter profile this week.\n\"michael burry deleting his account every time he shorts the local bottom will never stop being funny,\" a Twitter user who goes by foobar wrote this week. Musk replied with a pair of emojis crying tears of joy, suggesting he didn't take Burry's departure from the platform too seriously.\nMusk has previously labeled Burry a \"broken clock\" and teased him for betting against Tesla.\n\n                        \n                        \n\n\n                        \n                        \n\n—Elon Musk  (@elonmusk) February 2, 2023\nDebt dangers\n\"In turbulent economic times, be wary of using margin loans to buy stock,\" Musk tweeted on Thursday. The billionaire was referring to investors borrowing against the value of their shares and other securities to bolster their portfolios.\nMusk considered but ultimately didn't use a $12.5 billion margin loan to acquire Twitter last fall. The decision may have spared him a margin call — a demand from lenders to put up more collateral due to his Tesla stock plunging in value.\nThe close shave may explain why Musk has been underscoring the risks of margin debt in recent weeks, especially when investors face a volatile stock market and a potential recession.\n—Elon Musk  (@elonmusk) February 2, 2023\n \n\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                      \n                  \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                  \n                  \n                \n      \n                \n                  \n                  \n\n      \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          Read next\n                        \n\n                      \n\n                    \n                      \n\n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                      MI Exclusive\n                      Markets\n                      Stocks\n                    \n                      More...\n                    \n\n                \n                  \n                    \n                    \n\n                \n                  \n                        \n                          \n                          \n                        \n                        \n                          \n                          \n                        \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                    \n                      \n                  \n                    \nTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'.

I nearly freaked when I looked in the mirror, jumped on the accelerator and pulled back into my lane.'\nOthers said the auto-park feature was a flunk, taking longer and feeling less safe than if they were to just park the car manually.\n'I tried auto park three times and each time it saved me no time at all and brought me a lot of worry and panic from the person in the passenger seat who was worried the car would run itself into a pole, a curb, or someone else's car,' one person wrote on social media.\n'The car would do a fifteen point turn where one carefully executed turn was all that I ever needed.\n'In addition out of the three times I tried parking, the car never actually parked in the spot it initially identified and ended up parking in one or two spots over.'\n   \n \n   \n \n Others said the auto-park feature was a flunk, taking longer and feeling less safe than if they were to just park the car manually\n\n\n\n            \n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n                \n                    Share or comment on this article: \n\n                    Tesla owners slam enhanced autopilot safety assist as one car tries to drive into a tree\n\n                    \n                        \t\n                                            \n                                        \n\t\n                                            \n                                        \n\t\n                                \n                            \n\t\n                                \n                            \n\t\n                                \n                            \n\t\n                                \n                                    e-mail\n                                \n                            \n\t\n                                \n                                \n                            \n\t\n                                \n                                    14\n\n                                    shares\n\n                                \n\n                            \n\n\n                \n\n                \n              \n\n            \n\n            \n            \n                        \n            \n            \n\n                        \n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n             \n           \n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n              \n\n            \n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n        \n          Comments 23\n\n          \n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n    \t\n        \n        \n        Newest\n      \n\t\n        \n        \n        Oldest\n      \n\t\n        \n        \n        Best rated\n      \n\t\n        \n        \n        Worst rated\n      \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n      \n\t \n\tView all\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n\t\n\t  The comments below have not been moderated.\n\n\t\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n      \n\t \n\tView all\n      \n    \n\n    \n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      We are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n  \n    \n          \n\n          \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Bing\n      \n        \n          Site\n          Web\n        \n        \n          Enter search term:\n          Search\n        \n      \n\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Advertisement\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n  \n  \n   \n   \n  Femail Today\n\n  \t\n      \n\n          \n\n          \n            \n          \n\n\n\n        \n          \n          \n          Eighties pop legend is unrecognisable as she rocks multicoloured hair and a VERY racy outfit - but can YOU guess who it is?\n          \n          \n           \n        \n      \n    \n\t\n      \n\n          \n\n          \n            \n          \n\n\n\n        \n          \n          \n          Jennifer Lopez puts on a very busty display as she poses in lingerie for Intimissimi's Valentine's Day ad... after snapping at Ben Affleck during  Grammys\n          \n          \n           \n        \n      \n    \n\t\n      \n\n          \n\n          \n            \n          \n\n\n\n        \n          \n          \n          Fun mom!

Police body-camera footage of the nighttime confrontation shows the vehicle driving forward and the officers yelling for him to stop. \nThough it's unclear whether he was trying to intentionally target police or to flee, the officers' response was reasonable because they felt their lives were in danger as Frasure accelerated, Hamilton County Prosecutor Melissa Powers said. \nThe 28-year-old Frasure, who was from Lawrenceburg, Indiana, died Tuesday at a Cincinnati hospital, according to the coroner’s office. \nThe officers had been responding to a neighbor's report about a possible burglary happening at an apartment building that was supposed to be vacant, Powers said. \nAuthorities said Frasure and his father fled when police confronted them behind the building. Both men had active warrants related to previous charges or convictions, according to the prosecutor's office.\n  Frasure’s father told WLWT-TV they were there cleaning up the apartment of a relative who had died. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGo to MSN Home\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n     \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n\n                    \n                        AdChoices\n                    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\nHome\n\n\t\nNews\n\n\t\nWeather\n\n\t\nEntertainment\n\n\t\nMoney\n\n\t\nSports\n\n\t\nEsports\n\n\t\nLifestyle\n\n\t\nShopping\n\n\t\nBuy a car\n\n\t\nHealth & Fitness\n\n\t\nFood & Drink\n\n\t\nTravel\n\n\t\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n © 2023 Microsoft\n Privacy & Cookies\n Terms of use\n About our Ads\n Feedback\n Help\n MSN Blog\n About Us\n Editorial Standards\n Your California Privacy Choices\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n \n     \n    \n        \n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n \n",

Those safety questions are often punctuated by dangerous or even fatal incidents involving pedestrians and motorcycles (via CNN).\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly to the acoustic generators that the NHTSA requires EVs to activate at low speeds, there may be interesting, alternative strategies to address pedestrian safety â€” playing on human nature and behavioral science. While the product development teams are working on making the artificial intelligence behind automated driving safer, a team of researchers at the University of Tokyo published a paper containing some interesting research. Coming at the problem from a different angle, the researchers investigated interactions between self-driving cars and pedestrians in an attempt to make the vehicles more predictable to people on the street. A press release indicates some interesting findings that may be particularly useful to automakers â€” if they can make it look less goofy, that is.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    How eyes convey intention\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYouTube\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIt's fairly common knowledge that the human brain is quite adept at identifying faces, which is why we tend to see faces in inanimate objects, and even infer personalities in those imagined faces. A paper titled \"Can Eyes on a Car Reduce Traffic Accidents?\" found that this affinity for facial recognition â€” along with our keen eye for body language â€” can be used to help other road users predict what a self-driving car is about to do.\n\n\n\nThe researchers used virtual reality to simulate a scenario wherein 18 participants had to make a decision about crossing at a sidewalk while a self-driving car the size of a golf cart was approaching. To simulate hurried behavior, the decision had to be made within three seconds each time. The virtual vehicle was equipped with a pair of eyes on the front bumper that could articulate and move to indicate its attention. They ran four permutations of the same scenario â€” one where the car's eyes looked at the participant, indicating it had noticed them and intended to stop, another where it made no eye contact, indicating it had not noticed them, and two scenarios wherein the car had no eyes, so the participant didn't know whether it intended to stop.\n\n\n\nThe idea is that the car could indicate it has seen the pedestrians waiting to cross, giving the pedestrian confidence to cross knowing that the car will yield for them. Surprisingly, the results proved this hypothesis correct. Adding eyes to the car reduced the rate of incorrect decisions by 64%.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    But nobody wants cars with silly googly eyes\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhilip Lange/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLet's be honest â€” looks play a big part in the automotive purchase decision-making process, and it would be a shame to see technology hindered because of looks. For as long as there have been cars, there have been cars that have had faces, and they've always ended up as the butt of the joke at some point. Even the researchers involved in the study acknowledged this, stating in the press release that the research is merely a starting-off point, but that it would be best if engineers or designers came up with a more elegant solution. Case in point, a poll conducted during the study revealed that most female participants felt safer when the eyes were looking at them, while male participants mostly felt like they were in more danger as a result of the eyes.\n\n\n\nAesthetics aside, a 60% reduction in potentially fatal incidents is nothing to scoff at, and certainly warrants the attention of designers and automakers if they do actually care about pedestrian safety, so it certainly makes sense to pursue the idea if self-driving cars are ever to become mainstream.Â \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRecommended\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n",

I’ve written about flying cars, electric bicycles, trucks, ATVs, skidoos, and self-driving vehicles. I’ve written about most things that roll or skid on two, three or four wheels at one time or another. I have never, however, written about strollers. Thanks to the folks at Vancouver-based startup Glüxkind Technologies, that is about to change.\nGlüxkind has invented what the media are calling a “self-driving stroller.”\nThe baby technology startup, formed in 2020 by Anne Hunger and Kevin Huang, calls it “Ella” – an AI-powered smart stroller with hands-free navigation. Ella comes with a dual motor system for climbing hills, a rock-my-baby mode, an Intelligent Adaptive Braking System and automatic parking. Ella’s most significant feature, the one that recently earned the stroller an Honoree Award at the Consumer Electrics Show in Las Vegas, is its AI.\n\nElla has a 360-degree safety bubble made up of sensors. This, according to Glüxkind, “gives you an extra set of eyes. She monitors the surroundings and alerts you of potential dangers like cars, bikes, and scooters.” The stroller’s most flashy feature is its “hands-free mode,” which Glüxkind explains as follows: “When your child is not in the stroller and the stroller is unoccupied, Ella gives you the freedom to do what you need to do while she strolls on the sidewalk with you, at your pace.” If the child is in the stroller, hands-free mode will not work.\nPrice tag? A little under $5,000. Glüxkind (inspired by German for “lucky child”) is taking deposits for April orders.\nThe appearance of an AI-powered self-driving stroller raises a multitude of questions.\nIs Ella the best name for an AI-powered stroller that offers a hands-free mode?\n\nNo. The name Ella means “fairy maiden” in English, “goddess” in Hebrew and “torch” in Ancient Greek. “MT – the Babyless Stroller” would be a more appropriate name.\nI’m not a child care expert and can only speak from personal experience, but I’ve raised three children, and I can attest without equivocation that if any of them had figured out that they could be carried by mom or dad while their stroller magically rolled along without them, their bottoms would never have touched the seats. A self-driving stroller serves up the toddler trifecta. It combines snuggling with imposing your will on your parents with watching a funny machine perform a trick. Prediction: Parents of the future will have highly developed upper body muscles. Congratulations, chiropractors and physiotherapists, you may have many millions of new customers coming your way.\nWill some gearhead techie try to override the system so hands-free mode works with an object (like a dog) in it?\nAlmost certainly. Hopefully they fail.\n\nHow soon before someone is arrested for DUI driving the world’s first self-driving stroller?\nNot long after they figure out how to override the system. Never underestimate the human capacity to a) consume alcohol and b) misuse technology. It is one of our species-defining characteristics. If it can be driven, someone has tinkered with it and drove it drunk. Australian Chris Petrie was charged with driving a motorized cooler while impaired in 2011. The cooler could hold up to 48 cans of beer and Petrie was three times over the legal limit. He was fined. “It’s an unfortunate situation,” the magistrate said when delivering his verdict. “If he’d been drunk on a horse, he’d have been okay.”\nIn 2009, an Ohio man was hospitalized for minor injuries and was arrested after he drank 15 beers and crashed a motorized bar stool which he had fashioned out of an old lawn mower. “I wrecked my bar stool,” Wygle told the police when they arrived at the scene. Wygle said he got drunk after the crash, not before it. He received a year’s suspension, was sentenced to 60 days in jail (57 suspended) and fined US$375.\nGiven this propensity, the odds of someone getting lit up and crashing Glüxkind’s smart stroller are pretty good. My money is on fall 2023, around Thanksgiving.\n\nPower couple: Navigating Vegas with a hands-free stroller.OMAR YOUNIS/Reuters\n\n\nWhat about dogs and pets?\nI have no evidence or proof, but I would be stunned if someone has not already photographed a dog sitting in Glüxkind’s self-driving stroller. Failing that, it will happen immediately after the first Ella is sold.\nHave parents always been into the most cutting-edge technology when it comes to strollers?\nWhy yes. The first stroller was invented in 1733 because the Duke of Devonshire wanted to one-up his fellow nobles. He had Royal Garden architect William Kent create a “baby carriage.” This shell-shaped basket was perched on two wheels and could be pulled by a dog, small pony or a goat. Seconds after it hit the gravel, Lady Wishfort, Lady Fidget, Mrs. Loveit and Mrs. Foresight wanted one too. By spring 1734, Covent Garden was clogged with them.\nPerambulators (prams) evolved to satisfy parents’ eternal thirst for the best stroller to hold the best children in history. In 1895, the Tacoma Daily Ledger boasted that, “We propose that the future wheels of Baby Carriages shall have speedy outward movement filling up the want places in the land of Babydom.” In the Ottawa Citizen in 1898, baby carriage maker B. G. & Co. declared their “Convenient, Health-giving, Mother-resting articles” were a “relief to weary mothers” and a “blessing to sickly babies.”\n\nFrom then on, it’s been constant innovation. Stroller use boomed after the First World War. In 1965, the umbrella stroller was invented. And in 1984 came the jogging stroller.\nIs Ella the smart stroller actually the first motorized stroller?\nNo. W. H. Dunkley was a baby carriage magnate and head of Dunkley’s Ltd in London. Dunkley, who after the First World War only hired one-armed veterans, was developing a “pramotor.” In 1923, he unveiled a prototype (like our modern electric unicycles) at Atlantic City. The Atlantic City Dispatch wrote, “The nurse finds comfortable footing on either side of a low wheel, which is connected with the perambulator. This wheel has a gasoline tank and motor, so both nurse and baby roll along smoothly without effort by nurse except to repair punctures and keep the tank filled.” Sadly, Dunkley passed away in 1928 at the age of 68 and the pramotor went nowhere.\nBy 1935, Associated Press reported that souped-up strollers were popular in London. “Motorized prams or baby carriages semi-streamlined, with nursemaid walking with her hand on throttle instead of pushing as of old have become the rage in London’s fashionable West End. Colours are yielding to modern influences and babies of the rich ride in green, tan or yellow vehicles with the nurse, in some cases, attired to match. One London manufacturer has reportedly built a de luxe pram, costing $350 for a Hollywood film star’s baby.” Like the pramotor, these didn’t quite take off.\nInventors have been playing with the idea ever since with mixed results. In 2021, the world welcomed the e-Priam smart stroller, but Glüxkind’s Ella is the first self-driving smart stroller to hit the streets.\n\nWill Glüxkind’s self-driving stroller sell?\nYes. Faster than hotcakes at the World International Hotcake Eating Contest. Glüxkind promises that “Ella’s advanced parent assist technology empowers parents to be present and focus on their kids without compromise or distracting multi-tasking.” What bleary-eyed mom or dad wouldn’t want that no matter what the price?\nWhat’s next for AI-powered baby technology?\nIf Glüxkind could invent a self-changing diaper, I think we’d be set.\nFollow us on Twitter: @globedriveOpens in a new window\n\nReport an error\nEditorial code of conduct\n\n\nRelated articles\n\nAI-focused Radical Ventures makes Dominic Barton partner as it seeks to raise $550-million fund\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW’s all-electric i7 limo offers ‘goblin mode’ on the go\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the hype and crash investigations: What it’s like to drive with Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving’ feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Globe\n\nBuild your personal news feed\nMore info\nFollow the author of this article:\n\tAndrew ClarkFollowYou must be logged in to follow.Log InCreate free account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Following for new articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

To speed up the adoption of solar and storage in the residential energy sector, we’ve focused on providing products specifically designed for both the system owner and the installer. To develop the Tesla Solar Inverter, we leveraged our deep industry experience to design an inverter that offered the best value for system owners, while being easy to install, maintain, and service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla’s main claim in the paper is that its string inverter solution is cheaper at the purchase and through the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the paper, Tesla admits that its solution results in a lower production by about 1 or 2%:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then assessed the real-world performance data of these sites to characterize the effects of inverter type on the system’s output. We compared actual system performance data of sites with different inverter types but similar SES, ensuring only similar roofs were compared. For the homes that are good for solar (SES 6-10), sites that used optimizers saw energy production gains of 1-2% compared to homes that used Tesla Solar Inverters. When comparing the cost of Tesla Solar Inverter with MLPEs, it begged the question whether the production gains were worth the increased cost of the MLPEs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leading solar inverter company using optimizers is SolarEdge, which Tesla mentions in the white paper and appears to compare its solution to in this case.\n\n\n\n\nElectrek contacted SolarEdge for a comment on the comparison, and we will update if we get an answer.\n\n\n\n\nIn the paper, Tesla claims that the trade-off for the lower output was worth it since its analysis resulted in a 6% lower Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer this question, an LCOE analysis was performed to compare two 8 kW solar systems4. In the base-case scenario, our analysis found that the Tesla system had a 6% lower LCOE for the most common SES5. We also found that, for 93% of sites in the sample, Tesla had a lower LCOE. The difference in LCOE is driven entirely by higher inverter equipment costs. Further, the gap between LCOEs for SES 8 roofs expands to approximately 15% after factoring in the potential failures of optimizers during the service life6. These findings prove that over the system’s lifetime, the Tesla Solar Inverter will provide energy at a better value for most customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla also claims that its string solar inverter results in benefits for installers in terms of ease of installation and site design process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the full white paper:\n\n\n\n\nTesla-Solar-Inverter-Architecture-White-Paper-NA-EN-12212022Download\n\n\n\n\nElectrek’s Take\n\n\n\n\nThe white paper reads more like a sale brochure than a scientific paper, but it doesn’t mean that the data is inaccurate.\n\n\n\n\nI also found it interesting that the white paper also focused on the “Tesla ecosystem”:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the customer, Tesla Solar Inverter completes their Tesla ecosystem. System owners use a single app to monitor and manage their entire home energy system. Instead of sorting through multiple apps to make sure all devices are working properly, the Tesla app displays all Tesla products, including solar, Tesla vehicles, and charging. The intuitive app experience allows the customer to view and manage home energy usage across these devices, with the system optimizing for savings and efficiency. As new features are developed, they are automatically made available in the Tesla app, ensuring customers can unlock the full potential of their home energy system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tTop comment by Dana Weick\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nLiked by 32 people\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tComparing a string inverter with other string inverters would be an apples to apples comparison for a cost comparison of Tesla's design vs someone else's design.\n\nComparing them with microinverters is not.   There are advantages and disadvantages that drive the choice of a string inverter vs microinverters.\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\tView all comments\n\t\n\n\tWe have been seeing a shift in Tesla’s solar business lately where the company appears to be focusing more on providing its ecosystem supported mainly by the Powerwall, and now, the solar inverter.\n\n\n\n\nI think eventually that might be Tesla’s primary approach to achieving scale with its new Tesla Electric business. \n\n\n\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation or even just want to check out other options to make sure you’re finding a trusted, reliable solar installer near you that offers competitive pricing, check out EnergySage.

Learn More »\n\n  \n \n phototechno\n Thesis\n Peter Lynch probably is best known for picking 10 baggers. In his writings (e.g., Beating the Street is my favorite one), he divided stocks into 6 categories ranging from stalwarts, to turnarounds, to fast growers. And fast-growers seem to be Lynch’s favorites. These are stocks that can grow their annual earnings at 20%+ year. He mentioned multiple times an investor’s biggest gains come from fast growers. However, these fast growers are also inherently riskier.\n As such, he provided some guidelines for limiting the risks, which leads me to the main thesis of the day. in the remainder of this article, I will explain why Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) begins to fit these guidelines under current conditions. More specifically,\n \tA scale leader in a fast-growing industry. TSLA is a dominant player in the burgeoning electric vehicle (\"EV\") space, which has years, if not decades, of sharp growth curve ahead. \n\tInventories. Inventory level is a place that investors can easily check (but often don’t sadly). Inventories are one of the most reliable financial data (in the sense that they are less open to subjective interpretation). And yet inventories are highly indicative of the demand and health of any business. And you will see TSLA’s inventory level indicates its products are hugely popular and it has been very effective in managing its vast logistic systems amid all the ongoing challenges.\n\tA reasonable valuation. As mentioned, the Lynch PEG ratio (P/E multiple divided by growth rate) is now part of the daily investing vocabulary. He prefers a PEG around 1x for fast growers. You will see that TSLA’s current PEG is not as low as 1x yet. But it is getting close. My estimate is around 1.8x, justifiable for its unique strengths such as those just mentioned above.\n\n 1. A scale leader in a fast-growing industry\n Tesla has been the leading producer and seller of electric vehicles globally for several years. Other major EV makers such as Volkswagen, General Motors, and Toyota have also been ramping up their electric vehicle production and sales in recent years, but their numbers are still significantly lower compared to Tesla's as you can clearly see from the following chart. TSLA is the clear leader, with its Model Y and Model 3 X occupying the top 2 spots in market shares with Ford Mustang as distant third.\n Looking ahead, I see its leading position to sustain for various reasons, with scale itself and brand appeal as the top ones.\n In terms of manufacturing scale, Tesla has already passed the critical economies of scale as argued in my earlier articles, making it much more cost-competitive compared against other makers. And Tesla has cultivated a strong brand image and captured a large fan base with its sleek and minimalist design. At the same time, it keeps introducing “cool” features such as autopilot and over-the-air updates to keep the fans excited and anticipating.\n   \nsource: electrek.co\n 2. Inventory control\n As mentioned earlier, inventory is a place that investors can and should also check, especially for fast growers. It is a reliable indicator of the efficient use of resources, customer satisfaction, cash flow management, and also balance sheet management.\n The next chart shows TSLA’s inventories in absolute dollar amount (top panel), in terms of days outstanding (mid panel), and finally also as a percentage of its sales on a quarterly basis. In my mind, these results show all the signs that Lynch would like to see for a fast grower. To wit, as seen in the top panel, TSLA’s inventories have been increasing rapidly in terms of dollar amount, reaching $12.8B in the most recent quarter.\n However, the middle and bottom panels suggest that products are so popular and demand so strong that the inventories are below average in terms of day outstanding and as a percentage of sales. The middle panel shows that its current days of outstanding inventory hovers around 57 days, far below its historical average of 79 days. The bottom panel shows that its current inventory is only about 52.8% of its sales, far below the historical average of 71%.\n All told, I view these results as very indicative of the health of TSLA’s grow and management’s effectiveness. Amid all the ongoing challenges (such as COVID lockdowns and global supply chain disruptions), it has achieved a good balance between customer satisfaction (with a reasonable amount of inventory) and cash flow management (without too much capital tied up in inventories).\n   \nSource: Seeking Alpha data\n 3. Valuation and the Lynch PEG ratio\n As aforementioned, TSLA’s current PEG is not as low as 1x yet. My estimates of its current PEG ratio(S) are shown in the two charts below. These estimates are made based on a few assumptions to be detailed just in a little bit. And all told, I see a PEG ratio around 1.8x currently, again, not as ideal as the 1x that makes a perfect Lynch pick. But I see it as justifiable for its unique strengths such as its scale and premium brand image mentioned above.\n My PEG estimate is based on its FWD P/E ratio of 47.9x taken from Seeking Alpha as shown in the first chart below. Its EPS has been growing at a rate of 58% in the past 5 years (growth rates in the past 10 years are not meaningful in this case). Looking ahead, the consensus estimates project its EPS annual growth rates to be in the range of 18.8% to 30% as seen in the next few years. The CAGR is about 25%. And based on this CAGR, the PEG ratio turns out to be about 1.92x.\n Then finally keep in mind that TSLA current has a net cash position of $22.1 billion on its ledger, translating into about $6.7 per share. Thus, its P/E ratio is a bit lower if its cash position is accounted for (about 46.3x compared to the 47.9x before the adjustment). As a result, its PEG ratio is also a bit lower due to this adjustment (about 1.85x).\n   \nSource: Seeking Alpha data\n  Source: Author based on Seeking Alpha data\n Risks and final words\n Besides its PEG ratio being higher than 1x, TSLA investment entails a few other risks too. Competition in the EV is intensifying. A large part of TSLA’s success today owes to its early mover advantage. It was one of the first companies to enter the EV space and enjoyed a significant first-mover advantage. However, now all major auto makers, such as heavyweights like Volkswagen, General Motors, and Toyota, are all ramping up their electric vehicle productions. And as detailed in my earlier article, the colorful personality of its CEO, Elon Musk, is a double-edged sword. He has been criticized by the media for many things. And most recently, with his Twitter acquisition, he was criticized for being distracted with too many things (see details in this CNBC report).\n \n To conclude, I see TSLA begins to fit into all the criteria of Peter Lynch fast grower. It is a scale leader in a fast-growing industry. And in the way I see things, its inventory level confirms the health of its continued growth curve. Its PEG ratio (~1.8x according to my estimate) does not make it a perfect Lynch pick with 1x PEG. But I view it as justifiable given Tesla Inc's scale leader status and premium brand image.\n\nAs you can tell, our core style is to provide actionable and unambiguous ideas from our independent research.

We took a look at some of the biggest names in battery testing out there for public consumption today and ranked battery brands based on capacity, performance at various drain levels, temperature performance, weight, shelf life, their tendency to leak, and price.\n\n\n\n\nRanking brands is different from ranking batteries, of course, and it turns out to be a lot more complicated. You cannot necessarily trust that every battery made by one brand is automatically better than every comparable battery from any other given brand. We analyzed a metric ton of data and tried to make sense of which brands tend to do the best job. We combined our own efforts with data fromÂ Consumer Reports, Consumer NZÂ (a New Zealand publication), Gigazine (for power, capacity, and weight),Â Trailcam Pro (for cold weather performance), PowerStream (capacity), Wirecutter (for capacity after 50 charge cycles), and CinemaSound (for performance versus cost analysis) and others. We also looked at consumer reviews at Amazon, Lowe's, and Home Depot.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    The worst battery brand is UltraFire\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTtatty/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAs wonderful as eBay is as a resource for just about anything, it can also be a frustrating source of counterfeit and fake products. Let's look at the sad case of UltraFire, a Chinese battery brand that has become so closely associated with poor quality (and dangerous) fakes that it's impossible to recommend.\n\n\n\nFalse battery specs usually involve Ah ratings that are impossibly high, wildly exaggerated â€” or both. Consider the two UltraFire cells tested by Battery Bro. These were marked 4200 and 4900 mAh on their wrappers, but Ultrafire doesn't sell 18560 batteries claiming to have more capacity than 3400 mAh. (The maximum capacity for a 18650 Lithium-ion cell is generally considered to be 3500 mAh, and certainly no more than 3600). Occasionally, you might also find rechargeable cells that are actually worn-out older batteries re-wrapped and sold.\n\nThis is annoying, and maybe even fraudulent, but it's nothing compared to the other problem created by UltraFire and other counterfeits: the advertisement of cells as protected (with a circuit that preventsÂ problems like over-discharge), when in fact they are not.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    14500 Li-ion rechargeable battery brands\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Farias/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStrictly speaking, 14500 batteries and AAs aren't the same things. They are the same size and shape, or close to it, but 14500 Li-ions (roughly 14 mm in diameter by 50.0 mm in length) batteries have a nominal voltage of about 3.7v. AA Li-ion batteries, on the other hand, are normally 1.2v, and standard AA batteries are nominally 1.5v. So they're not interchangeable, and you'll break some things if you try to stick in a 14500 where an AA belongs. So why bring it up?\n\n\n\nThe 14500 is a whole class of batteries, and dozens of brands, that are either terrible or are counterfeited so frequently that attempting to buy one leaves you with a terrible battery. Those two things are functionally equivalent. Rather than listing a bunch of low-profile brands (like UltraFire) with the same set of problems, we're grouping these together as well. These rechargeables are often rated as high-drain with high (often fraudulently so) Ah capacity ratings.Â \n\nThey don't come close to the ratings, and they show incredibly steep capacity drop-offs even at the smallest loads. The names on this list might be familiar to anyone who's shopped for high-drain 18650 cells in the past, but all of these also produce batteries in the AA form factor. This list includes names like GTF, GTL, TrustFire, and Efest. Some of these companies make perfectly serviceable cells as well, and others appear to be prone to outright intentional misrepresentation, such as absurdly (and impossibly) inflated capacity ratings and advertised-but-missing features like protection circuits.\n\n\n\nThe missing protection circuits are a big deal because missing protection is one major cause of Lithium-ion batteries catching fire. This is why Amazon eventually banned the sale of 14500 and other cylindrical Li-ions outright.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Great Value\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWalmart\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMost of the criticism we saw concerning batteries labeled with Walmart's house brand, Great Value, seemed to center around the fact that Costco's Kirkland batteries are better. There's not a lot of test data on Great Value batteries, but what we've seen shows Great Value AAs having sub-par performance at lower current draws. This holds until you get into the range of the average LED flashlight, around 1 to 1.5 amps, at which point the Walmart brand performs about average, and stays middle-of-the-pack for higher levels of drain. The highest-drain tests we referenced for Great Value were 3 amps, via Henrik K. Jensen. At about 1 amp, these batteries would provide about an hour of life.\n\n\n\nGreat Value alkaline AAs have discharge curves that indicate a pretty standard alkaline performance â€” if a little low on capacity. The typical alkaline battery shows a gentle but steady decline in capacity as amperage increases, which then sharply falls off toward zero capacity at high levels of drain.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Fuji and Fujitsu\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaif al suwaidi/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBatteries branded Fujitsu and Fujifilm, often shortened to \"Fuji\" even on the company's branded products, are made by a company called FDK Group. This is the same company that makes some IKEA batteries, and FDK now owns the factories that used to make Sanyo batteries (usually labeled Panasonic, except for some reputable Li-ion cells in the 18650, 26500, and other offbeat sizes). So we're grouping Fuji and Fujitsu together not because of the name, but because they fell right next to each other in our rankings and turned out to be manufactured by the same company.\n\n\n\nFuji batteries were rated a little low on power by Gigazine. Of course, power and capacity aren't everything. CinemaSound rated the cost per hour for Fuji's EnviroMax AA at the highest of all alkaline batteries they tested, edging out the Duracell Procell.\n\nFujitsu is slightly more consistent in the sense that the battery brands we considered were almost all around the bottom of the pack, with the strange exception of the Fujitsu Universal Power AA. This battery has very low capacity at lower drains, but actually performs pretty well overall and tops the tests we reviewed for a 3-amp drain. Unfortunately, none of the other Fujitsu batteries tested had such an upside.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Kodak and Deleepow\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhotocharm86/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRight around 35 years ago, Kodak partnered with Matsushita in order to stake a claim in the booming battery market. Today, its partner is a startup called Wildcat Discovery Technologies to produce leading-edge EV batteries. But all along the way, the consumer batteries branded by Kodak have suffered.\n\n\n\nIn an industry full of confusing product names, Kodak seems to be among the most determined to make discussion as bewildering as possible. We looked at four Kodak AAs: Extra Heavy Duty, Max, Super Heavy Duty, and Xtralife. The Carbon Zinc offerings (typically these have \"heavy duty\" somewhere in the name) are had even for Carbon Zinc. The Extra Heavy Duty's high cost and mediocre duration scores made it the worst CinemaSound tested for cost per hour.Â \n\nThen there's Deleepow â€” which you probably haven't run across unless you've searched for this specific brand on Amazon. Based mostly on reviews fromÂ WirecutterÂ andÂ Amazon, we'd have to advise you to keep moving if you're looking for a strong and reliable rechargeable AA.\n\n\n\nWirecutter found that Deleepow's rechargeable batteries' capacities were often rated far higher than the batteries' actual, measurable capacities. The worst was the NiMH AA, which is rated by Deleepow at 3300 mAh, at the top of what is possible with an AA, but only measured 58 percent of that at 1917 mAh. Deleepow's Lithium-ion AA also underperformed. Interestingly, the company's Lithium-ion AAA was measured at a higher capacity than its rating.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    The soft middle: mid-range battery brands\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSasha Bulletti/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA lot of batteries with mediocre performance are hard to find, and it's even harder to find hard data detailed enough to rank their quality. So, in this category we're grouping a number of products from (or branded by) Eveready, CVS, Home Depot, Amazon Basics, Impecca, PNP Depot, Polaroid, RadioShack, and Sunbeam. We will discuss a few factors that distinguished each. Keep in mind that these are not, on the whole, particularly bad batteries. The middle of the pack, especially with regard to alkaline batteries, is often perfectly acceptable.\n\n\n\nEveready's alkaline Gold received mid-range scores fromÂ PowerStream, but CinemaSound found its cost per hour to be pretty good, and New Zealand's Consumer site actually recommended the battery based on acceptable performance and energy scores. The Carbon Zinc Super Heavy Duty didn't fare as well. Inconsistencies plagued the mid-range batteries overall. Amazon Basics batteries, for example, scored quite high when they were of the NiMH rechargeable variety, but their alkaline units didn't do as well.\n\nIn the fashion of nonsense battery naming practices everywhere, Polaroid's Super alkaline outperformed its Extreme. On the other hand, Consumer Reports gave CVS Health AA Alkaline batteries a poor score, but somewhat predictably found CVS Health MAX AA Alkaline batteries recommendable. PNP Depot's Lithium rechargeable got poor reviews at Lowe's, but near-perfect ratings at Home Depot. The only consistency in the soft middle is inconsistency.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    A whole gaggle of good 14500 Li-ion rechargeables\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdriana Iacob/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIn spite of all we've said about counterfeit and recycled cells destroying the Lithium-ion 14500 landscape, there are quite a few good ones out there as well. The trouble comes when you realize that, in many ways, the older NiMH chemistry still outperforms Lithium-ion rechargeables. Still, we must acknowledge the good ones, and some of the more highly regarded brands in the Lithium-ion rechargeable battery space include Samsung, Sanyo/Panasonic (who also make good 1.2v Li-ion rechargeables), LG, Sony, Shockli, Keeppower, LiitoKala, AWT, Tensai, Windyfire and Efan.Â \n\n\n\nThat said, there are still a lot better batteries on the list â€” we're only just past the middle of the pack, as it were. If you see any brands you've never heard of before today any lower on the list than this, don't be too shocked â€” there are more than a few battery companies doing good work in small batches.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Tenergy and Ansmann\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tClaudio Divizia/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTenergy might be better known for its chargers than for its batteries, but it turns out the company makes some high-quality NiMH rechargeable AAs. Wirecutter found the 800 mAh cell's capacity measured close to its advertised rate, and that the capacity remained high even after 50 charge cycles. Trailcam Pro tested some batteries' performance in cold temperatures, and found that the Tenergy Premium AA rechargeable maintained 86 percent of its room temperature capacity even down at 5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\n\nNext is German manufacturer Ansmann's batteries, which performed very well in independent testing. But you might have some difficulty finding them in a brick-and-mortar store. And they can be a little pricey. We charted data on two of their NiMH rechargeables (2500 and 2850 mAh). Both came close to their nominal capacity at .1 amps, and the 2850 mAh battery was one of the highest-capacity batteries we reviewed. Along with that high capacity, Jensen says, comes a high self-discharge rate, as detailed in the battery's datasheet. Jenson notes â€” with apparent surprise â€” that Ansmann publishes \"real datasheets\" for his batteries, an uncommon practice. Ansmann's alkaline also get good reviews on Amazon, managing 70 percent 5-star reviews on its 20-pack.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Rayovac and ACDelco\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRayovac\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRayovac always feels like a sort of legacy battery brand along the lines of Eveready, and probably would not have fared so well in our rankings but for the company's Fusion line, which enjoys a strong reputation among consumers and testers. Consumer Reports gave Fusion a high 85 rating, and reviews are overwhelmingly positive at Home Depot (4.8 stars), Lowe's (4.7 stars), and Amazon (4.6 stars). The Fusion models were rated as having a solid duration and moderate per-hour cost by CinemaSound. But based on tests of other Rayovac AAs, the company would be firmly in the middle of the pack without the Fusion line.\n\n\n\nSlashGear readers likely recognize ACDelco as a manufacturer of auto-related products such as belts and, in particular, batteries. In fact, ACDelco is owned by General Motors. But the company also produces well-regarded AA batteries for general consumer use. There's not a lot of test data out there. In CinemaSound's study, ACDelco had the cheapest AA alkaline and the second cheapest battery overall, and was tops in the study's best value marks in spite of the fact that the batteries have mediocre duration in the two types of tests CinemaSound ran.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    PKCell\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPKCell\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPKCell's alkaline and zinc batteries are fairly ordinary, although their Carbon Zinc topped CinemaSound's tests with fan duration. PKCell Ultra Alkaline batteries fell just behind the zinc PKCell batteries in those tests, but both did far worse in the second round of testing against Saramonic UWmic9 wireless transmitters.\n\n\n\nBut it's the company's NiMH rechargeable batteries we're looking at here that really perform well in testing. Their 1300, 2200, and 2600 mAh batteries all easily matched those ratings and handled high loads well. While the 1300 mAh battery performed well, Jensen notes that 1300 mAh is a considerably low capacity for your average AA battery. On the other hand, the 2600 mAh battery (which tested at 2801 mAh) was at the top of the capacity rankings for all AA cells. Like many of the battery brands on this list, they might not look like much, but they got it where it counts.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Panasonic and Eneloop\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnatoly Vartanov/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThis is another case of two batteries falling next to each other in our rankings and conveniently appearing to be more than just ships passing in the night:Â these batteries turn out to be made by the same company. (This is no secret. Lots of batteries are labeled \"Panasonic Eneloop.) The other was Fujifilm and Fujitsu, and wouldn't you know it? FDK also used to make Eneloops. All of this inbreed... err, cross-pollination aside, Panasonic tends to make highly regarded batteries... although there are some exceptions.\n\n\n\nIn all, we looked at ratings, tests and reviews for 24 Panasonic and Eneloop batteries. There were some misses; Wirecutter rated Eneloop NiMH rechargeables poorly, and Jensen didn't have much love for a 2050 mAh Panasonic Evolta NiMH. Consumer.org.nz gave Panasonic's Extra Heavy Duty a \"Don't Buy\" rating, but gave it to all the other Carbon Zinc batteries as well. Otherwise, Panasonic cells did well across the boards, generally matching their capacity ratings and performing well.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Duracell and Kirkland\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMehaniq/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIt's not going to surprise anyone that Duracell and Energizer are our top-ranked brands, but it was a little to see how large the gap was. The only dings the company took in our research was the less-than-stellar reputation of its NiMH rechargeables of all sorts â€” but these tend to suffer for every manufacturer, and as often as not this is either a misunderstanding by or the fault of the consumer.\n\n\n\nIt might still surprise a few people that Costco's own brand Kirkland makes a set of AA batteries that've appeared near the top of test results, not just for Consumer Reports but also among Henrik Jensen's tests. And it shouldn't surprise anyone that Kirkland batteries are made by Duracell.\n\nTaking the two brands as one, there's a lot of variation in test results, but overall many more wins than losses. Duracell had three batteries (Duracell Coppertop Duralock AA Alkaline,Â Duracell Quantum AA Alkaline,Â and Kirkland Signature (Costco) AA Alkaline) at the top of Consumer Reports' last battery roundup, and two in Gigazine's as well. With the exception of the 1300 mAh Duralock rechargeables, the batteries performed well and met their rated capacities.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n    \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    The best battery brand is Energizer\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tzamzarina abdullah/Shutterstock\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEnergizer (who also makes Eveready) just edged out Duracell in our rankings, but they could easily have been reversed. (A couple of alkaline batteries with low (and possibly outdated) rankings from Consumer Reports made most of the difference, and the scores weren't that bad. Mostly, though, Energizer's products across the entire spectrum of AAs â€” from alkaline to Lithium-ion â€” tend to perform well.\n\n\n\nFor example, two Energizer batteries topped Consumer Reports' last Lithium-ion battery rankings. Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries and NiMH Energizer Recharge batteries stood above and beyond the rest, while Energizer as a brand, as a whole, found their way to the top of the battery bunch.\n\nAgain, the top spot could as easily have gone to Duracell, as Duracell general alkaline AAs outperformed Energizer slightly. But overall, Energizer ended up being the most consistent and most impressive of the battery brands we examined that are available on the market today.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRecommended\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n",

Members of Envision Early Retirement get exclusive ideas and guidance to navigate any climate.  Learn More »\n\n  \n \n phototechno\n Thesis\n Peter Lynch probably is best known for picking 10 baggers. In his writings (e.g., Beating the Street is my favorite one), he divided stocks into 6 categories ranging from stalwarts, to turnarounds, to fast growers. And fast-growers seem to be Lynch’s favorites. These are stocks that can grow their annual earnings at 20%+ year. He mentioned multiple times an investor’s biggest gains come from fast growers. However, these fast growers are also inherently riskier.\n As such, he provided some guidelines for limiting the risks, which leads me to the main thesis of the day. in the remainder of this article, I will explain why Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) begins to fit these guidelines under current conditions. More specifically,\n \tA scale leader in a fast-growing industry. TSLA is a dominant player in the burgeoning electric vehicle (\"EV\") space, which has years, if not decades, of sharp growth curve ahead. \n\tInventories. Inventory level is a place that investors can easily check (but often don’t sadly). Inventories are one of the most reliable financial data (in the sense that they are less open to subjective interpretation). And yet inventories are highly indicative of the demand and health of any business. And you will see TSLA’s inventory level indicates its products are hugely popular and it has been very effective in managing its vast logistic systems amid all the ongoing challenges.\n\tA reasonable valuation. As mentioned, the Lynch PEG ratio (P/E multiple divided by growth rate) is now part of the daily investing vocabulary. He prefers a PEG around 1x for fast growers. You will see that TSLA’s current PEG is not as low as 1x yet. But it is getting close. My estimate is around 1.8x, justifiable for its unique strengths such as those just mentioned above.\n\n 1. A scale leader in a fast-growing industry\n Tesla has been the leading producer and seller of electric vehicles globally for several years. Other major EV makers such as Volkswagen, General Motors, and Toyota have also been ramping up their electric vehicle production and sales in recent years, but their numbers are still significantly lower compared to Tesla's as you can clearly see from the following chart. TSLA is the clear leader, with its Model Y and Model 3 X occupying the top 2 spots in market shares with Ford Mustang as distant third.\n Looking ahead, I see its leading position to sustain for various reasons, with scale itself and brand appeal as the top ones.\n In terms of manufacturing scale, Tesla has already passed the critical economies of scale as argued in my earlier articles, making it much more cost-competitive compared against other makers. And Tesla has cultivated a strong brand image and captured a large fan base with its sleek and minimalist design. At the same time, it keeps introducing “cool” features such as autopilot and over-the-air updates to keep the fans excited and anticipating.\n   \nsource: electrek.co\n 2. Inventory control\n As mentioned earlier, inventory is a place that investors can and should also check, especially for fast growers. It is a reliable indicator of the efficient use of resources, customer satisfaction, cash flow management, and also balance sheet management.\n The next chart shows TSLA’s inventories in absolute dollar amount (top panel), in terms of days outstanding (mid panel), and finally also as a percentage of its sales on a quarterly basis. In my mind, these results show all the signs that Lynch would like to see for a fast grower. To wit, as seen in the top panel, TSLA’s inventories have been increasing rapidly in terms of dollar amount, reaching $12.8B in the most recent quarter.\n However, the middle and bottom panels suggest that products are so popular and demand so strong that the inventories are below average in terms of day outstanding and as a percentage of sales. The middle panel shows that its current days of outstanding inventory hovers around 57 days, far below its historical average of 79 days. The bottom panel shows that its current inventory is only about 52.8% of its sales, far below the historical average of 71%.\n All told, I view these results as very indicative of the health of TSLA’s grow and management’s effectiveness. Amid all the ongoing challenges (such as COVID lockdowns and global supply chain disruptions), it has achieved a good balance between customer satisfaction (with a reasonable amount of inventory) and cash flow management (without too much capital tied up in inventories).\n   \nSource: Seeking Alpha data\n 3. Valuation and the Lynch PEG ratio\n As aforementioned, TSLA’s current PEG is not as low as 1x yet. My estimates of its current PEG ratio(S) are shown in the two charts below. These estimates are made based on a few assumptions to be detailed just in a little bit. And all told, I see a PEG ratio around 1.8x currently, again, not as ideal as the 1x that makes a perfect Lynch pick. But I see it as justifiable for its unique strengths such as its scale and premium brand image mentioned above.\n My PEG estimate is based on its FWD P/E ratio of 47.9x taken from Seeking Alpha as shown in the first chart below. Its EPS has been growing at a rate of 58% in the past 5 years (growth rates in the past 10 years are not meaningful in this case). Looking ahead, the consensus estimates project its EPS annual growth rates to be in the range of 18.8% to 30% as seen in the next few years. The CAGR is about 25%. And based on this CAGR, the PEG ratio turns out to be about 1.92x.\n Then finally keep in mind that TSLA current has a net cash position of $22.1 billion on its ledger, translating into about $6.7 per share. Thus, its P/E ratio is a bit lower if its cash position is accounted for (about 46.3x compared to the 47.9x before the adjustment). As a result, its PEG ratio is also a bit lower due to this adjustment (about 1.85x).\n   \nSource: Seeking Alpha data\n  Source: Author based on Seeking Alpha data\n Risks and final words\n Besides its PEG ratio being higher than 1x, TSLA investment entails a few other risks too. Competition in the EV is intensifying. A large part of TSLA’s success today owes to its early mover advantage. It was one of the first companies to enter the EV space and enjoyed a significant first-mover advantage. However, now all major auto makers, such as heavyweights like Volkswagen, General Motors, and Toyota, are all ramping up their electric vehicle productions. And as detailed in my earlier article, the colorful personality of its CEO, Elon Musk, is a double-edged sword. He has been criticized by the media for many things. And most recently, with his Twitter acquisition, he was criticized for being distracted with too many things (see details in this CNBC report).\n \n To conclude, I see TSLA begins to fit into all the criteria of Peter Lynch fast grower. It is a scale leader in a fast-growing industry. And in the way I see things, its inventory level confirms the health of its continued growth curve. Its PEG ratio (~1.8x according to my estimate) does not make it a perfect Lynch pick with 1x PEG. But I view it as justifiable given Tesla Inc's scale leader status and premium brand image.\n\nAs you can tell, our core style is to provide actionable and unambiguous ideas from our independent research.

Its operating income and net income were also record highs.\n\nAbout 439,000 vehicles were produced and 405,000 were delivered between October and the end of the year. This caps off a year in which Tesla's deliveries increased 40% over 2021, churning out 1.31 million electric vehicles. Production grew by even more, about 47% to the tune of 1.37 million.\n\nIn a press release, the company attributed the increase in deliveries to regional vehicle builds.\n\n\"Thank you to all of our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and supporters who helped us achieve a great 2022 in light of significant COVID and supply chain related challenges throughout the year,\" the press release said.\n\nTotal revenue grew 37% year over year in quarter four, reaching $24.3 billion.\n\nThe United States and Canada represent Tesla's highest market share, up to about 3.5%, compared to about 2% in Europe and 2% in China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Model 3/Y continues to lead the way in production and deliveries for Tesla vehicles, with more than 400,000 produced and nearly 400,000 delivered in the fourth quarter.
